還沒來得及說上話
I haven't really caught up with him yet,

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.750
你得換套衣服
I need you to get dressed.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.640
為什么把我帶來這里
Why am I here?

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.510
請穿上這套衣服  相信我
Please put on these clothes. Trust me.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.240
這是手銬鑰匙
This is the key to your cuffs.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.340
帶上這些
Take these.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.510
不是吧
Oh, my Jesus.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.270
你還好吧
Are you okay?

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:58.910
怎么了
What?

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:02.150
你是不是有查加林的文件
Do you have the file on Chagarin?

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.620
你就是一直在混這個嗎  杰克
This is what you been doing, Jack?

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.450
間諜這一套
Spy shit?

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.620
就這樣嗎
This is it?

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.460
你是個間諜嗎  老天啊
You're a spy? Oh, my God.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:20.000
新澤西州平原鎮的007
The 007 of Plainfield, New Jersey.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.500
好極了
Very nice.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.940
麥克蘭  閉嘴
McClane, shut up.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.740
007系列里的反派  金手指的手下

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.470
我在度假
I'm on vacation.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:28.570
你媽媽肯定很高興
Your mom will be pleased.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.180
我們還以為你在制毒
We thought you were doing drugs or something.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:31.710
科馬洛夫先生
Mr. Komarov.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.180
或是販毒  但那是我的想法
Or selling drugs, but that was me, really.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.680
你有可以指證查加林的文件嗎
Do you have the file on Chagarin?

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.820
有還是沒有
Yes, or no?

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.020
這很簡單  尤里
It's very simple, Yuri.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.330
你把文件給我  我幫你離開俄羅斯
You give me the file, and I get you out of Russia.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.030
還你自由身  怎么樣
And you're a free man. What do you say?

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.170
這和我無關  我不在乎我的命
It's not about me. I don't care about my life.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.600
這是我們的條件
Well, that's the deal.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.340
唯一能給的條件
It's the only deal.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.340
考慮一下
Come on.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.050
別這樣  尤里  幫幫你自己
Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.280
你打算怎樣
What's it gonna be?

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.580
答不答應
Yes or no?

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.120
時間不等人  尤里  快決定
The clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.820
你們會救我出去嗎
You will get me out of here?

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.690
就憑你們三個人嗎
Only the three of you?

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.830
俄國佬  我跟他們不是一伙的
Whoa, Nijinsky. I'm not in the gang.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.460
我剛下飛機  時差都還沒倒過來
I just got off the plane. I'm still jet-lagged.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.300
這件事和我無關  對吧  杰克
I'm not involved in this. Huh, Jack?

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.510
我要帶我女兒一起走
Only if I can take my daughter with me.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.080
查加林的人會殺了她
Chagarin's people will kill her.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.550
好吧  動作快點
Fine. Make it quick.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.920
文件在哪里
Where's the file?

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.300
在普里皮亞季的一個保險庫里
It's in a vault in Prypiat,

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.820
但鑰匙在莫斯科
but the key is here in Moscow.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.420
烏克蘭酒店
At Hotel Ukraina.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.130
見鬼  打給你女兒
Shit. Make your call.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.900
我們去烏克蘭酒店  走吧
We're going to the Ukraina, let's go.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.570
是我  爸爸
It's papa.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.940
我沒事  寶貝兒
I'm fine, Sunshine,

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.580
等會再說
we'll talk later.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.480
聽著
Listen.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.490
我會在我和你媽
I'll be waiting for you

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:18.220
第一次一起跳舞的地方等你
where your mother and I shared our first dance.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.450
現在就去
Now.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:22.920
快點過去  聽懂了嗎
Hurry! Hurry! You understand?

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.200
邁克  今天早上的事我很抱歉
Mike, listen, I'm sorry about this morning, man.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.910
沒事
It's fine.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.410
好了  我們走吧
Okay, let's go.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:48.910
有敵人
Contact!

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.150
趴下  快趴下
Down! Get down!

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.350
趴下  快走
Go! Get down! Go, go, go!

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.130
約翰  找掩護
John, cover!

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.880
快點  小子
Come on, buddy!

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.280
快走
Go! Go!

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.090
去死吧  混球
That's right, jerk-off!

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.460
好了  我們快點走  約翰
All right, let's move, John!

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.790
老子他媽的在度假
I'm on fucking vacation!

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:34.460
快點  該走了  別撞到頭
Come on, time to hustle. Watch your head.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
麥克蘭  快點
McClane, move it.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.560
飛了他媽的八千英里就給我這個
8,000 fucking miles for this?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.270
蹲下  尤里  蹲低點
Stay down, Yuri. Stay low!

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.540
低頭
Head down.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.640
快點  快走
Come on. Go, go!

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.990
什么安全屋  安全個蛋
Safe house, my ass.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.630
他知道我們上了年紀吧
He knows how old we are, no?

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.960
走吧
Come on.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.740
這邊
Here, here, here.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.170
坐下  你沒事的
Sit down. You're all right.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.670
讓我看看
Let me look at you.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.540
沒事  你沒事
It's all right. You're fine.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.440
你在干什么
What are you doing?

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:28.980
杰克
Jack.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.380
冷靜點  尤里  你不會有事的
Just Calm down, Yuri, okay? You're gonna be just fine.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.820
把這個穿上  別著涼了
Here, put this on, stay warm.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.720
你搞什么  約翰  五分鐘嗎
What was that, John? Five minutes?

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.590
你用五分鐘就搞砸了一個計劃三年的行動
Five minutes, you blew a three-year op in five minutes!

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.760
不用客氣  你還想我怎么樣
You're welcome! What do you want me to do?

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.360
難以置信
Unbelievable.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.600
我完蛋了  我在這里沒別的朋友
I'm so fucking burned. I got no friends in this town anymore.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.250
總部的人呢
What about your people at Langley?

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.340
打個電話給他們
Just give them a call.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.040
把你的手機給我
Give me your phone.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.350
我還有兩年的話費沒花呢
It's a two-year contract on that phone.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.290
你拿著什么  給我
What are you carrying? Give me that.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.920
好吧  你身上有錢嗎
All right. You got any cash on you?

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.660
只有一些美元
Some American money.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.430
你們在搞什么  我們不能停下
What are you talking about? We need to keep on moving.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:19.730
我們得帶他看醫生  給他療傷  杰克
We have to get this guy to a doctor. To medical attention, Jack.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:20.370
任務還沒結束
The mission stands.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.970
你的任務快流血致死了
Your mission is bleeding out over there.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.000
任務繼續  我們去酒店
The mission continues. We go to the hotel.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:33.380
快  我們走吧  我們走
Come on, let's move. Let's move.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.290
真是胡來
This is nuts.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.260
你要出去殺人嗎
What, are you going to go out and kill somebody else now?

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.560
為什么費這么大勁要救他
Why all this trouble for just one guy?

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.900
他是個政治犯
He's a political prisoner.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.530
你是不在乎  約翰
Not that you care, John,

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.830
但這關系到國家安全  明白嗎
but it's a matter of national security, all right?

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.440
他有辦法阻止維克多·查加林
He's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin,

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.370
這也是我們要做的事
and we need that to happen.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:37:59.970
好極了  杰克
Well, great, Jack.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.840
把他送到大使館吧  我們就可以回家了
Let's drop him off at the embassy, and we can go home.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.260
你在開玩笑嗎
Are you kidding me?

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.580
你沒看到安全屋里發生的事嗎
After what happened at the safe house?

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.180
聽著  那樣做行不通  懂嗎
Look, it doesn't work like that, all right?

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.650
這會是場外交災難  而我是可犧牲的人
It's a huge diplomatic mess, and I'm a burnable asset.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:13.120
所以我要拿到那份文件  挽回這次任務
So, I now need that file to un-fuck this mission.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.450
還有其它問題嗎
Any more questions?

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:15.390
只有一個
Yeah, just one.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.520
為什么你從來不聯系我  告訴我你在哪里
How come you never called and told me where you were?

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.730
說了也白說
Like you'd give a shit.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.240
好  等等  停下
All right, hold up, hold up.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.710
尤里  聽我說  勝利在望了
Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right? We're almost done.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.010
我們一拿到鑰匙  就去拿文件
As soon as we get that key, we're gonna grab the file,

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.020
然后把你和你女兒救出俄羅斯  好嗎
get you and your daughter out of Russia, all right?

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.690
好的
All right.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.760
聽我說  你做得很好
All right, listen to me, you're doing good. All right?

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.130
你在這里等一會  盯著他  約翰
I need you to hang here a second. Keep an eye on him, John.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.490
喂喂喂
Hey, hey.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:00.370
你小子怎么叫我約翰  怎么不叫爸了
What is it with all this "John" shit? Whatever happened to "Dad?"

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.700
問得好
Good question.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:08.570
俄語里有個詞來形容他這樣的人
In Russia, we have word for men like him.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.840
Krutoi
"Krutoi."

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.210
意思是"強硬"  "固執"
It means "tough," "hard."

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:18.450
在美國的意思是"失足青年"
In America, it means "juvenile delinquent."

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.620
你就他一個兒子嗎
Is he your only child?

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.060
不  我還有一個女兒
No. I got a daughter, too.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.100
你呢
You?

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.600
我只有一個寶貝女兒
I have only my Solnyschka.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.970
她小時候  我一直都在工作
When she was little, I was working all the time.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.910
我當時覺得只有工作才最重要
I believed work was all that mattered.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.580
我孩子的人生也被我毀了
I screwed my kid's life up, too.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.240
我沒日沒夜地工作
You work all the time around the clock,

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.090
大部分時間都在當警察
most of the time, when you're a cop.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:40:01.930
我只是覺得一直工作是好事
I just thought that working all the time was a good thing, you know?

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.430
我沒能好好照顧他
I didn't help him at all.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:14.440
有心不怕遲
It's never too late,

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.940
希望如此
I hope.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.750
好了  我們走
Okay, let's go.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.590
尤里  宴會廳在大樓的哪個位置
All right, Yuri, which part of the building is the ballroom in?

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.490
在主樓
Main tower.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.490
主樓第幾層
Main tower. Which floor?

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.500
頂層
Top floor.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.030
頂層
Top floor.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.630
安全措施怎么樣
What about security?

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:42.270
有保安  攝像頭之類的嗎
You remember any guards? Cameras? Anything like that?

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.070
我不知道
I don't know.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.270
你得回憶起來
Well, I need you to remember.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.570
我坐了五年牢  我怎么會知道
I was in prison for five years, how should I know?

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.540
-一切可能都變了  -我知道
- Everything could have changed. - I know.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.180
好好想想  腦海中想象出畫面
Just think, all right? Picture it in your head.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.310
舞廳在89年的時候就關了
The ballroom was closed in '89.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.720
我覺得那里正在裝修
I think it's under construction now.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.950
所以說那層樓沒有安全措施
So that floor's unsecured.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:01.590
我不知道  聽著  我女兒在里面
I don't know! Listen! My daughter is in there.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:02.990
我快被嚇死了  我們走吧
I'm scared to death, let's go!

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.290
冷靜點  尤里
Just calm down, Yuri.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:32.920
估計你以前也干過那事
I guess you have done that before.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.890
真聰明
Smart.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.760
我也做得到
I could have done it.

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.700
伊琳娜
Irina?

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.740
伊琳娜
Irina?

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:37.650
伊琳娜
Irina?

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.790
爸爸
Papa.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.130
-伊琳娜  -爸爸
- Irina. - Papa!

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.170
真感人
That's tender.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.670
是嗎  我不知道
Really? I wouldn't know.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:08.610
要抱一個嗎
Need a hug?

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.320
我們家沒這傳統
We're not really a hugging family.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.150
那倒是
That's right.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:18.190
我們只要再拿一樣東西
We just have to get one thing,

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:21.130
就可以永遠離開莫斯科了
and then we're leaving Moscow for good.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.490
好嗎
OK?

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:23.360
好的
OK.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.340
他們是誰
Who are they?

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.480
年輕的是中情局特工
The young one works for CIA.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:41.080
老頭子是他爸  美國人
The old one is his father. Americans.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.980
感謝上帝他們來了
Then thank God for them.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.850
我有種不祥的預感
There's something no good about this.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:49.990
閉上嘴  行嗎
Just shut up, all right?

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.860
我告訴你  杰克
I'm telling you, Jack,

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.260
事情不對勁
this smells bad.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.160
別說了  好嗎
Just stop, okay?

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.830
這也許對你來說很陌生
This might seem like a totally foreign concept, you know?

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.340
我知道你最愛舉著槍沖進去砰砰砰
I know you love to just run in, making shit up.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.310
可我是專業人士  我做事有計劃
But like any professional, I have a plan.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:09.440
按我的計劃來  明白嗎
So let's just stick to it, okay?

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.440
那你快按照計劃行動吧
Just move your plan along.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.680
好了  尤里  我們拿了鑰匙就走吧
All right, Yuri, come on. Let's grab the key, get out of here.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.350
好的
Yes.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.820
給我幾分鐘就行
Just take a moment.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.300
你還好嗎
How you doing?

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.410
我很好
Fine.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.150
你怎么這么快就到這里了
How did you get over here so quick?

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.690
那個
Well

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.490
我走了花園環路
I took Garden Ring.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:04.830
花園環路是吧  那里不是一直很堵嗎
Oh, the Garden Ring. Supposed to always be bad, right?

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:16.740
約翰
Hey, John.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.510
你沒遇上堵車嗎
Did you get stuck in traffic?

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:23.110
我拿到鑰匙了
I have it! I have it.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.220
歡迎啊  美國佬
Welcome, Americans.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:36.490
把槍放下  你這混蛋
Put your goddamn guns down, asshole!

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.310
爸爸  這是怎么了
Papa, what is going on?

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.610
交出你們的武器
Give me your weapons.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.550
有種自己來拿
Come and get them.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.250
當真
Really?

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.590
是的
Really.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.460
爸爸
Papa.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.130
尤里
Yuri.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:13.630
快照做
Do it.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.600
我還以為就你是問題兒童
I thought you were a problem child.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:38.620
這也是你的計劃嗎  專業先生
This a part of your plan, Mr. Professional?

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.690
你這是做什么
What are you doing?

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:44.860
是為了錢  爸爸
It's about money, papa

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.360
很多錢
millions of dollars.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.570
你在監獄里的時候
You think life was easy for me?

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:50.600
你以為我過得輕松嗎
While you were sitting in prison being a victim?

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.540
但我是你父親啊
But, I'm your father.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.140
我也是你的乖女兒
And I am your daughter.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.350
現在該把這老頭殺了吧
We should kill the old man now.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.020
他還有用
We still need him.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.880
你可以殺了這兩個人
But them you can kill.

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:07.850
多謝
Thank you.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.160
你們好
Hi.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.990
我的發音還準確嗎
I don't know if I'm saying this right.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.500
你們好
Hi.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.540
知道我最煩美國佬什么嗎
Do you know what I hate about the Americans?

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.970
什么都煩
Everything.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.540
最煩的是逞英雄的牛仔
Especially cowboys.

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:53.560
我本來可以去跳舞  我發誓
I could have been a dancer. I swear to God.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.770
但沒人支持我
But nobody supported me.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.310
你們兩個
You two

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.180
還真是
have been such a

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:14.620
讓人討厭
pain in the ass!

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:27.600
快走  快
Come on, come on

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.600
我還真的更喜歡跳舞
I prefer dancing, really.

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:38.540
但比起在雜貨店打工  殺人算是個好差事了
But killing is much, much better than working in a grocery shop!

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.380
老天爺啊
Jesus Christ!

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.850
這拳不錯
Nice one.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:05.070
你們兩個自大的混蛋
You guys. So arrogant.

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:07.570
現在不是1986年了  明白嗎
It's not 1986, you know.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:11.540
里根都死了
Reagan is dead.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.850
-怎么了  -老天吶
- Sorry. - Oh, God.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.130
有什么好笑
What's funny there?

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.970
你不懂
Can't tell you.

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.470
不是你滑稽  我挺喜歡你們的行頭
It's not you. I love these outfits.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.810
你們看上去真心不錯
You guys are looking good.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:51.850
笑夠了吧  謝謝
That was enough, thank you.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:56.450
比劃兩下吧
Let's dance.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.210
快點  快走
Come on! Come on!

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:28.320
杰克
Jack!

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.290
還記得你出走前我們最后一次談話嗎
Remember the last time we talked just before you went away?

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.390
沒門
Oh, no! No, no!

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:38.060
你別想在我們死前向我敞開心扉
You're not gonna open up to me right before we die!

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.270
那可不是你的風格  約翰
No, that's not your thing, John.

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.870
那我是什么風格
What's my thing?

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:45.240
把壞蛋都殺光  那是你的風格
Fucking killing bad guys, that's your thing!

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.570
你今天可不會死
You're not gonna die today!

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:17.700
快走
Go!

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.170
媽的
Shit!

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.940
我操
Fuck.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:55.670
我們沒戲了  約翰
We're finished, John.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.820
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:15.960
太他娘的難以置信了
I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.570
杰克
Jack. Hey!

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:35.480
老天啊
Jesus!

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:40.220
快走
Come on!

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.090
快逃出這幢樓
Let's get out of this building!

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.810
他們在哪
Where are they?

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.350
快走
Come on.

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:37.510
阿歷克  就這樣吧  我們完事了
Alik, that's it. We're done!

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:38.210
走吧
Let's go!

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:39.210
向左轉向
Break left!

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:40.340
收到  指揮官
Copy, Commander.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:15.610
抓到他了嗎
Do you have him?

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.950
是的
Yes.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:18.050
文件呢
And the file?

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.050
在他身上嗎
Does he have it?

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:22.620
我需要那份文件  阿歷克
I need that file, Alik.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.660
他會帶我們去找文件
He's taking us to it.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.360
別再犯錯了  阿歷克
No more mistakes, Alik.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.690
拿到文件之后
And when you have the file

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.230
把父女倆都殺了
kill them both.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.930
是  長官
Yes, sir.

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:55.250
媽的
Shit.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.830
真刺激
That was exciting.

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:04.800
是啊  超有趣
Yeah. Loads of fun.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.970
想再來一次嗎
You wanna go again?

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.270
你中槍了嗎
Are you shot?

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:13.440
沒有
No.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.140
我沒事
No, I'm fine.

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:17.410
讓我看看你的傷口
Let me take a look at that.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:19.440
我沒事
It's fine.

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:20.880
媽的
Oh, fuck.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.220
不敢相信她為了查加林背叛了她父親
I can't believe she betrayed her father for Chagarin.

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.820
完全無法理解
I don't understand that.

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:32.820
以后你會懂的
Someday you will.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.060
這就是孩子
Kids.

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.700
你的下一步計劃是什么
What's our next move?

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.000
我不知道
I don't know.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.040
-你不知道嗎  -我不知道  好了吧
- You don't know? - I don't know, all right?

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:48.070
我是說  我徹底沒轍了
I mean, I'm out of moves. I don't know.

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:50.010
不知道怎么辦
I don't know.

00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:53.010
我搞砸了
I screwed up.

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:55.480
我搞砸了任務
I blew the mission.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:04.920
那我們玩完了吧
Well, then we're done, right?

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.020
是的
Yeah, we're done.

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.420
結束了
We're done.

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.990
那我們就一起回家吧
We should just go home.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:12.200
離開莫斯科的路上找個小藥房
We'll stop by a little pharmacy on our way out of Moscow,

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:16.070
此處應指硫汞苯磺鈉  為常見消毒藥

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:18.900
把你的小撓傷治一治
and fix up your little scratches, here.

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.840
送你回家  買套小玩具
Get you home. Get a little toy set.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:25.280
來杯加了巧克力糖漿的熱牛奶
Get yourself a nice warm glass of milk with a little Bosco in it.

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.180
再穿上你的中情局特供小拖鞋
Get your CIA slippers.

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:28.380
好了好了
All right.

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.510
-怎么了  -我懂了
-What? - I get it.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.550
你說我們下一步怎么辦吧
What the hell are we gonna do?

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.220
那文件是什么
What's in the file?

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.260
扳倒查加林的證據
Evidence on Chagarin.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.600
什么證據
Evidence about what?

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.730
切爾諾貝利
Chernobyl.

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:51.300
聽我說
Look, listen to me.

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.140
在以前  科馬洛夫和查加林
Komarov and Chagarin used to have this

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:58.130
一起合伙做過黑市交易
nasty little side-racket going on back in the day.

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:03.950
提煉武器級的鈾  他們太貪心了
They siphoned weapons-grade uranium, got greedy,

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:06.980
導致了核電站的災難
caused the meltdown.

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.320
后來  他們鬧崩了
Then, you know, they fell out.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.590
曾經的合作伙伴反目成仇
Former partners, bad break-up.

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:17.800
全是人渣
Scumbags.

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.800
查加林把科馬洛夫關進監獄
So, Chagarin had Komarov thrown in jail.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.030
讓他從此不見天日  被人遺忘
You know, put him in a hole, forget about him.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.600
也就沒必要擔心他了
Doesn't have to worry anymore.

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.310
那這次營救行動又是怎么回事
So what happened to rescuesque?

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:32.110
他良心發現了
Well, he grew a conscience.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.710
好吧  那倒也講得通
Yeah, well, that figures.

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:40.650
聽著  查加林作惡多端  他才是罪魁禍首
Listen, Chagarin is bad news. He's the real deal.

00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.880
你手指被梯子夾到了
Got your finger caught in the ladder,

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.780
你哭了五六天呢
you cried for about five, six days.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.590

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:50.850

我們需要輛車

這是車臣幫派聚會
It's a Chechen hangout.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.200
老板不讓帶槍進去
Owner doesn't like guns in the club,

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.570
所以這幫人就把槍留在車里
so these bozos leave them in their cars.

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.940
三年學了不少東西
Learn a lot in three years.

是的  深感抱歉
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:14.430

But all the radioactive stuff is out, right?

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.200
和你回憶中的一樣嗎  爸爸

我不想去回憶
I don't want to remember.

我想我們就這么從邊上包抄過去

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.910

No. No, you're not.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.810
鑰匙  這是你的保險庫吧  尤里
The key. It's your vault, isn't it, Yuri?

01:17:24.810 --> 01:17:28.290
什么  不  不是
What? No. No, I...

01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:29.810
是你把鈾放在這的吧
You put this shit in here, right?

01:17:30.370 --> 01:17:31.740
什么  不是
What? No.

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:32.460
是吧
Right?

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.090
我什么都不知道  杰克
I didn't know, Jack.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.350
躺在那邊那個是跳舞仔嗎
Is that the dancer down there?

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.090
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.320
這么強壯的人居然栽了
That's a tough break for a good athlete.

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:52.040
杰克  你了解我
Jack, you know me.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.430
是的  我了解你
Yeah, I know you. I know you.

01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:00.360
但我更了解他
I know him better.

01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.440
根本就沒什么文件吧  尤里
Never was a file, was there, Yuri?

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.370
當然沒有
Of course there was no file.

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:20.870
它只是個誘餌
It was simply bait.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.840
我要的東西在這個保險庫里
What I needed was in this vault.

01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:25.860
只有查加林還有這個
Chagarin was the only one

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:28.350
權力和影響力把我弄出監獄
with enough power and influence to get me out of jail.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.770
我利用了他
I used him.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.000
也利用了你
I used you.

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.250
這都是因為錢
It's about money.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.800
這不都是為了錢嗎
When's it not about money?

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.200
你要逮捕我嗎
You want to arrest me?

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.230
這里不是你的管轄區
You're out of your jurisdiction,

01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:50.030
麥克蘭警官  是吧
Detective McClane, aren't you?

01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:52.370
這個不用我操心了
I wouldn't worry too much about being arrested.

01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:57.800
我兒子是中央情報局的人
See, my boy is in the CIA.

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.120
他都不用打電話報告
No phone call.

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.460
間諜那一套  你懂的
Spy shit.

01:19:04.050 --> 01:19:08.350
混蛋美國人  總是自作聰明
Goddamn Americans. You think you're so smart.

01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:11.950
不  我沒那么聰明  我只是在休假
No, I'm not that smart. I'm just on vacation.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.430
我兒子
My boy here,

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:17.230
他會好好修理你一頓
he gonna put a whooping on you.

01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:23.670
快走
Move!

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:34.060
你可以去和你女兒道別  你個人渣
You can say goodbye to your daughter, you dumbwit fuck.

01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:42.650
你的陽光寶貝在哪呢
Where's your little Soltschanitsa?

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.690
操  該死
Shit! God damn it!

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:04.230
我操
Shit!

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.220
伊琳娜  我正往屋頂跑
Irina, I'm going to the roof...

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:29.490
屋頂
The roof!

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.020
杰克
Jack!

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:53.080
位置設定為91
Set at 91.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.140
發動機準備好了嗎
Power plant?

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:55.210
準備完畢
All good to go.

01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:56.050
起飛吧
Let's go!

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:24.870
真帶勁
Subtle.

01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:28.050
這他媽手榴彈用什么做的
What the hell is in those goddamn grenades?

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:36.090
你去抓尤里
Go get him!

01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:38.920
我去直升機那里
I'm going to the helicopter!

01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:34.610
瓦迪姆  注意機尾
Vadim, watch the tail.

01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:37.280
收到  現在所處高度為120米
Copy. You are at 120 meters...

01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:39.110
115米
115 meters...

01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:08.460
屋頂出現小規模交火
There is small arms fire coming from the roof.

01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:23.030
有人上來了
We have a guest.

01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:26.000
幫我注意機尾情況
Watch the tail for me there.

01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:34.640
快點
Come on!

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:35.800
快過來
Come on, hurry!

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:38.640
瓦迪姆  讓我來控制火力
Vadim, give me firing control now...

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.140
準備開火
Engaging!

01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:47.480
杰克
Jack!

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:51.020
快打死他
Shoot him!

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:52.490
樂意之極  爸爸
With pleasure, papa.

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.330
老子他媽的還在休假
I'm on fucking vacation!

01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:05.400
瓦迪姆  他在那里  我看到他了
Vadim! He is there! I see him!

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.940
父母為了孩子真是操碎了心
The shit we do for our kids.

01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:17.350
歡呼吧  混賬東西
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.850
怎么回事
What happened?

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:33.200
重心不穩了
CG's shifted...

01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:35.460
儀表盤開始亂轉
I've got full forward cyclic.

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.960
我失控了
I can't hold it.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.940
我的老天
Jesus Christ!

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:18.710
干得好
Well done,

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.910
超級間諜先生
Mr. Super-spy.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:27.340
可惜你父親活不到看見你升職了
What a shame your father won't be alive to see you promoted.

01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:30.420
你也活不了
Neither will you.

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:47.640
杰克
Hey! Jack!

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:51.740
堅持住  約翰
Hang on, John!

01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.610
約翰

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.690
趕快走
Come on!

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.630
彈藥用完了
We're out of ammunition!

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.060
操
Shit.

01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:50.770
這些混蛋
Bastards.

01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:53.200
你想干什么
What the hell are you doing?

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.390
我來為你報仇  爸爸
This is for you, papa.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.070
約翰
John!

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:05.870
約翰
John!

01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:08.410
約翰
John!

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.050
約翰
John!

01:28:21.690 --> 01:28:23.130
爸爸
Dad!

01:28:25.130 --> 01:28:26.500
我在這里
Right here.

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:55.460
你剛是叫我爸爸嗎
Did you just call me Dad?

01:28:56.890 --> 01:28:58.260
沒有
No.

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:01.260
你明明叫了
I didn't think so.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.600
你聽錯了
You're hearing things.

01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:08.240
你耳朵不好使
You got swimmer's ear.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.800
我們不會多長一只手什么的吧
We're not gonna grow any third arms or anything, are we?

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.330
不會的
No.

01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:23.690
但你頭發會掉光
You might lose your hair.

01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:25.650
盡管嘲笑我吧  孩子
Laugh it up, kid.

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.350
五年后你也這樣了
This is you, five years from now.

01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.180
這只是雨水  不會有事的
It's rainwater. You'll be fine.

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:34.880
而且麥克蘭家的人命都硬得很
Besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.

01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:37.430
現在你是麥克蘭家的人了嗎
Now you're a McClane?

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:41.690
當然  我是約翰·麥克蘭
Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane.

01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:43.350
你是小約翰·麥克蘭
John McClane Junior.

01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:46.560
好吧  那你就是大約翰了
Well, that makes you a "senior."

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.650
沒錯
That's right.

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:50.050
你給我記住了
Try not to forget it.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.390
我是你父親
I'm your father.

01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:55.180
對你父親尊重點
Have some respect for your father.

01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:58.340
我問你啊
Let me ask you something.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.620
你是老喜歡找麻煩
Do you go looking for trouble

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:04.340
還是麻煩老找上你
or does it always just seem to find you?

01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:09.170
這么多年來
You know, after all these years,

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.130
我也一直在想這個問題
I still ask myself the same question.

01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:02.970
Doom and Gloom  滾石樂隊

01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:03.270
昨晚我做了個夢
I had a dream last night

01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:05.140
夢見我開著飛機
That I was piloting a plane

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:08.780
所有的乘客都在發酒瘋
And all the passengers were drunk and insane

01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:12.620
飛機墜毀在路易斯安那州的沼澤地
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.420
開槍射擊一群僵尸
Shot up a horde of zombies

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.100
我占著上風
But I come out on top

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.860
這個夢到底代表什么
What's it all about?

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:22.030
只是反映著我的心境而已
Guess it just reflects my mood

01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:25.070
沉浸在骯臟的世界
Sitting in the dirt

01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:27.080
感受著那樣的傷痛
Feeling kind of hurt

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:33.630
我所聽到的全是死亡和哀愁
All I hear is doom and gloom

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:41.090
黑暗籠罩著我的房間
And all is darkness in my room

01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:48.120
透過光芒我看清你的臉
Through the light your face I see

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:50.800
寶貝  給自己一個機會
Baby, take a chance

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.510
寶貝  來和我舞一曲
Baby, won't you dance with me

01:32:56.730 --> 01:32:59.910
異國戰爭使我失去一切
Lost all that treasure in an overseas war

01:32:59.910 --> 01:33:03.800
只是證明了你付出卻沒得到該有的匯報
It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.110
你該擔心愈多的戰爭將導致愈多的貧困
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor

01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:08.970
我把腳翹在沙發上
Put my feet up on the couch

01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:11.450
鎖上了所有的門
And lock all the doors

01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:12.700
聽那流行的音樂
What's that funky noise?

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:16.750
就跟拴緊的螺絲一樣緊繃
It's the tightening of the screws

01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:19.930
沉浸在骯臟的世界
Sitting in the dirt

01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:21.710
感受著那樣的傷痛
Feeling kind of hurt

01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:28.270
我所聽到的全是死亡和哀愁
All I hear is doom and gloom

01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:35.450
但是當這些鼓聲咚咚響起時
But when those drums go boom, boom, boom

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:43.200
透過光芒我看清你的臉
Through the light your face I see

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.430
寶貝  給自己一個機會
Baby, take a chance

01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:49.840
寶貝  來和我舞一曲
Baby, won't you dance with me

01:33:52.710 --> 01:33:57.260
寶貝  來和我舞一曲
Baby, won't you dance with me

01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:21.690
這深不見底的油井
Fracking deep for oil

01:34:21.690 --> 01:34:23.610
里面卻什么都沒有
But there's nothing in the sump

01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:27.540
小孩撿拾著垃圾
There's kids all picking at the garbage dump

01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:29.230
我要逃出這趟渾水
I am running out of water

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:31.210
所以我最好加足馬力
So I better prime the pump

01:34:31.210 --> 01:34:32.770
我試著保持清醒
I am trying to stay sober

01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:34.910
但最后還是醉了
But I end up drunk

01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:36.460
我們吃著骯臟的食物
We'll be eating dirt

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:40.370
像游民一般住在道路旁
Living on the side of the road

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.940
真是個耐人尋味的問題
There's some food for thought

01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:48.560
搞得你腦袋像要爆炸一般
Kind of makes your head explode

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.140
感受著那樣的傷痛
Feeling kind of hurt

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:59.480
我所聽到的全是死亡和哀愁
But all I hear is doom and gloom

01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:06.950
黑暗籠罩著我的房間
And all is darkness in my room

01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:14.210
透過光芒我看清你的臉
Through the light your face I see

01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:17.830
寶貝  給自己一個機會
Baby, take a chance

01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:22.160
來和我舞一曲
Won't you dance with me

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:25.220
來吧
Come on!

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:28.360
寶貝  來和我舞一曲
Baby, won't you dance with me

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.580
感受著那樣的傷痛
I'm feeling kind of hurt

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:35.970
寶貝  來和我舞一曲
Baby, won't you dance with me

01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:38.930
沉浸在骯臟的世界
Sitting in the dirt

01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:43.430
寶貝  來和我舞一曲
Baby, won't you dance with me
