00:00:00.951 --> 00:00:02.722
罗马之骄子下访此地
We are only too happy

00:00:02.747 --> 00:00:05.139
我们深感荣幸
to receive Rome's favored son.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.983
制造武器一举
The manufacture of armaments

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.132
甚为挑衅
could be construed as a provocative move.

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:11.673
我敢肯定宫廷之中藏有密探
I believe there may be a spy in my court.

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:13.484
如果我们有什么事要通知你
If we have something to convey to you,

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.203
则会刻字母欧米伽(Ω)
we will inscribe the letter Omega.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.691
告诉你们的教皇 不论是弗洛伦萨
Tell your Pope that neither Florence

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:23.452
还是我达·芬奇都决不受他牵制
nor Da Vinci will be contained.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.592
无论这钥匙配的是什么样的锁
Whatever lock this corresponds with,

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.063
我敢打赌 它必须和另外一把一起使用
I'd wager the key represents only half.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.032
缺了另一把钥匙 他的那一把便成不了事
The key is useless without its counterpart.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.368
你听说过《叶之书》么?
Have you heard of the Book of Leaves?

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:37.771
这只是个传说  和独角兽一样不可信
It's a myth. No more real than a unicorn.

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.376
你和萨尔维亚蒂最好集合一切军力准备迎战
You and Salviati should assemble the largest army you can find.

00:00:41.444 --> 00:00:45.013
大师 去工作吧  佛罗伦萨就指望你了
Get to work, maestro. Florence is counting on you.

咱们开始吧
Shall we?

00:02:28.963 --> 00:02:33.267
我觉得这游戏很有趣
I find the game fascinating.

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:36.238
看似很简单 不是么
Deceptively simple, isn't it?

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:39.975
我为您准备了晚餐
I have a repast.

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:42.077
说说都有什么
Say it.

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:45.381
果仁甜饼 奶酪和葡萄酒
Panpepato, cheese, and wine.

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:47.116
果仁甜饼是你做的吗
You made the panpepato?

00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:49.685
是的  因为您喜欢吃
Yes. Because you like it.

00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:52.378
胸有成竹之时

00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:54.958
万难均可克服

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:05.300
- 你说的是阿姆哈拉语吧   - 是的
- Was that Amharic? - Yes.

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.837
阿比西尼亚 埃塞俄比亚的旧称 非洲东部国家

00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:11.573
我刚说的是 你很尊重她
I said that you hold her in high regard.

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:17.713
她劳作辛勤 信奉上帝 通晓我们的语言
She labors hard and has embraced both the Lord and our language.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.048
是你教她的 是不是
You taught her, didn't you?

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:24.776
没错  正如你带着足够的耐心和毅力
I did. Just as you teach me this game

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:26.589
教我玩这个游戏
with patient persistence.

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:29.558
现在 咱们可以开局了吗
Now, shall we get to play?

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:30.826
事实是
That's the thing.

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:32.528
我还未触碰棋盘
I've yet to touch the board

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:35.264
便已开始了游戏
but already I've begun.

00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:41.670
游戏的首要原则 是先取角落
The first principle is to take the corners.

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:43.438
策略一目了然
The strategy is obvious.

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:46.508
角落易于防守
The corners are easier to defend.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.550
非常漂亮  品质上乘 缝纫精致
It's brilliant. High grade, beautifully milled.

00:03:54.618 --> 00:03:56.719
但就是缺了点东西
But it's missing something.

00:03:56.787 --> 00:04:00.723
我晓得了 缺的是漂亮的梭结花边
I know! A jaunty bobbin lace is what it needs.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.893
即便我们身陷局部冲突
But even as we engage in localized conflicts

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:09.965
也仍要时刻心怀大局
it is important to keep the broader landscape in mind.

00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:23.913
只有一边紧锣密鼓地求胜
The game can only be won by pursuing

00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:29.085
一边貌似节节退让 才能取得胜利
seemingly opposing objectives simultaneously.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.395
在任意时刻
At any given moment.

00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:42.731
卢克雷齐娅 亲爱的 过来给我们一点建议
Lucrezia, my dear, come tell us what you think.

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.602
棋子可用以代表以下三种状态之一
A stone can be considered to inhabit one of three states

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.706
活棋 死棋 及未下之棋
alive, dead, or unsettled.

00:04:50.774 --> 00:04:52.841
卢克雷齐娅 你能来一下吗
Lucrezia can you come out here, dear?

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.744
未下之棋 自然代表着
An unsettled stone naturally presents the player

00:04:55.812 --> 00:04:59.948
拥有最大潜力之玩家
with the largest potential outcomes.

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:04.052
- 你要出门吗   - 是的
- Are you heading out? - Yes.

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.121
- 在宵禁之后吗   - 没事啦
- After curfew? - I'll be fine.

00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:08.523
- 这样不妥吧   - 我要去拜访金妮维亚
- Is that wise? - I'm calling on Ginevra.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.476
我从勃朗峰买回一些草药
I bought some herbs from the Monte Bianco

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.892
可以治疗她的皮肤病
to treat her tetter.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.694
但我可能需要你帮忙
But I may need your help.

00:05:13.762 --> 00:05:17.265
我相信恩佐可以帮你打点一切
I'm confident that Enzo is capable of handling all of your needs.

00:05:17.332 --> 00:05:18.767
晚安
Goodnight.

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:21.970
一名能够控制游戏走向
An opponent who can control the flow of the game

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:24.139
却又好似专于防守的对手
while appearing to play defensively

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:28.377
通常最为可畏
is often the most formidable.

00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:35.050
走了  走了
Go on. Move on.

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:43.224
走啊  站起来
Come on! Stand up straight.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.574
继续  走啊
Go on. Move on.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.230
到左边看看
Look down here on the left.

00:06:31.508 --> 00:06:35.177
- 多纳蒂夫人   - 德拉戈内蒂队长
- Signora Donati. - Captain Dragonetti.

00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:36.463
像您这样尊贵的夫人
Isn't it late for a woman

00:06:36.464 --> 00:06:38.414
这么晚了还出来散步 不大妥吧
of your standing to be out for a stroll?

00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:41.384
要是秉公办理 我就应以违反宵禁的罪名逮捕您
On principle, I could arrest you for violating curfew.

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:45.221
是的  但你我都知道 最后受到惩罚的
True. But we both know that it would be you, and not I,

00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:47.089
只会是你 而不是我
who would receive punishment.

00:06:49.193 --> 00:06:51.260
尽享夜色吧 夫人
Enjoy the evening air, Signora.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.810
- 晚上好 瓜尔贝托   - 夫人
- Good evening, Gualberto. - Signora.

00:07:07.878 --> 00:07:09.512
您今晚看上去美极了
You look lovely this evening.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.181
- 一如既往   - 谢谢
- As always. - Thank you.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.724
你心跳加速了
Your heart is racing.

00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:23.392
我没想到你在这里
I didn't expect you to be here.

00:07:26.163 --> 00:07:28.498
我实在无法在宫殿里多等一分一秒
I couldn't wait for you any longer at the palazzo.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.205
洛伦佐
Lorenzo.

00:07:35.272 --> 00:07:36.540
让我来吧
Let me.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.597
游戏最难以掌握的策略叫做
One of the most difficult strategies to master is called...

00:08:33.665 --> 00:08:36.232
"瞒天过海"
"Cross The Sea Unseen".

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.001
- 达·芬奇
- Da Vinci!

00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:42.105
它要求发现敌方弱点
It entails identifying the weakness in an opponent's position

00:08:42.173 --> 00:08:45.508
在不被察觉的情况下加以利用
and exploiting it beneath their notice.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:52.349
达·芬奇  洛伦佐以为你已经到铸造厂了
Da Vinci! Lorenzo believes you are already at the forge!

00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:56.754
达·芬奇
Da Vinci!

00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:03.528
怎么啦
What?

00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:05.330
你怎么没有一大早赶过去
Why weren't you there at first light?

00:09:05.397 --> 00:09:06.965
他们要在黎明时浇铸枪炮
They cast guns at sunrise.

00:09:07.032 --> 00:09:09.167
贝奇 我又不用亲自浇铸铁水
I don't have to pour the metal myself, Becchi.

00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:11.203
这些武器对佛罗伦萨的安危至关重要
These weapons are vital to Florence's safety

00:09:11.271 --> 00:09:14.206
而你现在的身份是一名战争工程师
and you've sold yourself as a war engineer.

00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:15.851
哪儿来的一股毒气的味道
What is that noxious smell?

00:09:15.852 --> 00:09:16.542
我在做实验
It's an experiment.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.577
我在评估我枪炮的威力
I'm assessing the implications of my guns.

00:09:20.748 --> 00:09:22.782
达·芬奇
Da Vinci!

00:09:43.204 --> 00:09:44.204
达·芬奇
Da Vinci!

00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:47.040
啊 大师你终于来了
Ah, there you are, Maestro.

00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:49.876
我相信武器铸造得很顺利 是吗
Production progressing smoothly, I trust?

00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:53.747
就铸造条件来看 和预计的一样顺利
As smoothly as can be expected, given these working conditions.

00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:58.084
是 但是炮车  咱们说好的是十架 没错吧
Yes, but my guns. We will have ten, as promised, yes?

00:09:58.152 --> 00:10:01.121
我们拒绝接受罗马为比萨指派的大主教
Our refusal to accept Rome's Archbishop of Pisa

00:10:01.188 --> 00:10:03.790
这使我们对于防御的需要只增不减
only reinforces the need to bolster our defenses.

00:10:03.858 --> 00:10:05.348
我非常清楚
I am acutely aware of the

00:10:05.349 --> 00:10:07.794
洛伦佐大人正承受着巨大的压力
pressures converging on His Magnificence.

00:10:09.163 --> 00:10:11.598
那个双目浑浊的混蛋到底在那干什么
What the devil is that cloudy-eyed miscreant doing over there?

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:15.435
- 音调偏低   - 停下
- The tonality is off. - Stop!

00:10:15.503 --> 00:10:18.010
我们这位目盲朋友的敏锐听力
Our sightless friend's keen ears

00:10:18.011 --> 00:10:19.939
检测出了成品中有杂质
have detected an impurity.

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:24.076
太荒唐了
This is absurd.

00:10:24.143 --> 00:10:25.844
你是不是改动了铸造方案
Your methods, what's changed?

00:10:25.912 --> 00:10:28.881
没有  我依照指示 用了最好的材料
Nothing. I've used the finest ore, as dictated.

00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:31.383
- 那么温度呢   - 和您嘱咐的一样
- Well, then, the heat... - Precisely as instructed.

00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:34.286
不过有那么一会 硫磺用完了
Well, there was that one moment when we ran out of sulfur.

00:10:34.354 --> 00:10:36.072
为什么没人咨询一下我
Why wasn't I consulted?

00:10:36.073 --> 00:10:36.989
那只是个意外
It was incidental.

00:10:37.057 --> 00:10:40.225
到底怎么了
What exactly is the issue here?

00:10:40.293 --> 00:10:42.060
如果他们使用劣质合金
If they've used an inferior alloy,

00:10:42.128 --> 00:10:44.029
就目前来说 硫磺用量不达标
in this case, too little sulfur,

00:10:44.097 --> 00:10:45.115
那么炮筒的声响
then the sound the guns

00:10:45.116 --> 00:10:47.065
就会比预计低一半
make will be half as loud as they should be.

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:49.568
谁他妈在乎这玩意的声响啊
Who cares about the fucking sound?

00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:51.770
我们不是来这里陪你演戏的
We're not doing more of your goddamn theatre.

00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:53.772
而是要用它们来消灭敌人
They need to obliterate the enemy.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.141
将他们炸成碎片的
Blow them to bits.

00:10:56.209 --> 00:10:58.677
- 请放手   - 就不放怎地
- Please unhand me. - Or what?

00:10:58.744 --> 00:11:00.345
你是在拿勺子威胁我吗
You're threatening me with a spoon now?

00:11:00.413 --> 00:11:01.813
朱利亚诺
Giuliano!

00:11:06.854 --> 00:11:08.721
如我刚才所说
As I was saying,

00:11:08.789 --> 00:11:11.910
从炮筒的音色
the timbre of the barrel

00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:17.763
可以判断它的属性
is also indicative of its general properties.

00:11:17.831 --> 00:11:19.265
返工
Start again.

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:21.734
这次别吝啬硫磺
Don't scrimp on the sulfur this time!

00:11:21.802 --> 00:11:25.271
他不敢的
He won't.

00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:26.873
你把我当傻瓜一样
You treat me like a fool.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.109
可我是有领导才能的
But I'm capable of leading.

00:11:30.177 --> 00:11:32.411
- 人们都爱我   - 他们爱的是你的脸
- The people love me. - They love your face.

00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:35.397
但你的鼻子长得再英挺
But that smooth nose of yours

00:11:35.398 --> 00:11:38.050
也阻止不了罗马的侵袭
won't keep Rome from striking.

00:11:38.118 --> 00:11:40.786
只有达·芬奇的炮可以
Only Da Vinci's guns will.

00:11:45.593 --> 00:11:47.193
尼克 过来
Come, Nico.

00:11:47.261 --> 00:11:50.830
这帮美第奇家的巨头又开始看轻我了
These Medici currency vouchers are weighing me down.

00:11:50.898 --> 00:11:53.333
我真想飞走 不再受这世界的束缚
I need to fly, be free of this world.

00:11:55.602 --> 00:11:57.971
你这里所有的鸟儿加一起 卖多少钱
How much for your entire inventory?

00:11:58.038 --> 00:12:00.106
要比你上次付的多
More than you gave me last time.

00:12:00.174 --> 00:12:02.208
两弗罗林吗
Two florins?

00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:03.810
还算公道 鸟痴
How about it, bird man?

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.214
帮忙 尼克
A little help, Nico?

00:12:07.282 --> 00:12:08.582
借过
Excuse me.

00:12:13.688 --> 00:12:15.022
开笼
Now!

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:37.377
这种景象我百看不厌
I never tire of watching that.

00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:46.286
为什么这一只不愿飞走
Why didn't this one fly away?

00:12:46.354 --> 00:12:48.455
达·芬奇先生
Signor Da Vinci.

00:12:48.523 --> 00:12:50.456
你我如此稀疏会面
When will you ever finish my portrait

00:12:50.524 --> 00:12:53.693
你要何时才能完成我的画像
if we sit together so infrequently?

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.597
大师 我去帮你多收集些鸟蛋制作颜料
Maestro, I'll pick up some more eggs for your pigments.

00:12:57.664 --> 00:13:01.667
你是要去拜访 还是刚离开洛伦佐
On your way to or from Lorenzo, then?

00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:04.103
你很清楚我的处境 列奥纳多
You know my situation, Leonardo.

00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:09.742
飞啊
Just go.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.811
你自由的机会来了
This is your chance,

00:13:11.878 --> 00:13:15.381
笼子打开了
the cage is open.

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:16.849
你以为 醉心知识可以帮你
Do you think your pursuit of knowledge

00:13:16.917 --> 00:13:19.785
免疫一切情感吗?
makes you immune to your emotions?

00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:22.088
你知道吗 你逃避不了情感的
You can't outrun them, you know.

00:13:23.457 --> 00:13:25.024
你知道吗 我不是在逃避
Do you know, I'm not running.

00:13:25.092 --> 00:13:28.093
只是我的情感之间满是冲突
I just have competing interests.

00:13:31.364 --> 00:13:33.265
就像你一样
Like you.

00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:38.738
很有趣不是吗 这只鸟
Curious, that bird.

00:13:38.805 --> 00:13:40.506
钱我已经拿到了
And paid for.

00:13:40.574 --> 00:13:43.376
你要是不带走它 我就吃掉它
You take it or I eat it.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.548
如今 棋局已开枝散叶
So, the plot thickens.

00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:50.081
你已脱身局部交易
You've broken off from a

00:13:50.082 --> 00:13:52.585
并开辟了一条新战线
local exchange and opened up a new front.

00:13:52.653 --> 00:13:54.022
现在正是将一点混乱
I thought it was time a

00:13:54.023 --> 00:13:56.523
引入游戏的时机
little chaos was introduced into the play.

00:14:00.894 --> 00:14:03.529
发生什么事了
What's going on?

00:14:03.596 --> 00:14:05.196
我的身体里
Inside me...

00:14:05.264 --> 00:14:08.867
有 恶 魔
the... the... devil...

00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:12.636
撕扯着我的子宫 折磨着我
..Clawing at my womb, damning me!

00:14:15.173 --> 00:14:16.440
哦天哪
Oh, dear God.

00:14:19.544 --> 00:14:20.845
不可能的
It can't be.

00:14:20.913 --> 00:14:23.081
别碰她 我们还不清楚她到底被染上了什么
Don't touch her. We don't know what afflicts her.

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:23.834
我不能不管
她是多洛莉丝修女
I have to help her. It's Sister Dolores.

00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:25.000
我是在修道院里认识她的
I knew her at the Convent.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.551
怎么回事
What is it?

00:14:25.551 --> 00:14:29.254
她是最善良无邪的人  多洛莉丝
The sweetest, most innocent soul. Dolores?

00:14:29.322 --> 00:14:32.691
你  找点人来帮忙 叫些军官过来
You there. Find some officers, bring them here.

00:14:32.758 --> 00:14:35.026
是我啊 凡妮莎
It's me - Vanessa.

00:14:36.729 --> 00:14:40.766
你 和你哥哥洛伦佐 正把这里变作另一个索多玛
You, your brother, Lorenzo, making a new Sodom,

00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:42.301
因罪恶而被上帝毁灭

00:14:40.834 --> 00:14:42.301
吞咽污秽
gorging on filth,

00:14:42.368 --> 00:14:44.970
再将罪孽呕吐于佛罗伦萨的街道上
spewing out sin onto Florence's streets.

00:14:45.037 --> 00:14:47.138
上帝痛恨你们
The Lord hates you!

00:14:47.206 --> 00:14:48.820
这个女人中什么邪了
What has befallen this woman?

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:49.974
大人 是恶魔附体
Demons, signor.

00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:51.680
我们圣安东尼修道院的五位姐妹
Five of our fellow sisters from

00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:54.112
都已经被恶魔附身了
the Convent of St Anthony have been possessed.

00:14:55.514 --> 00:14:58.883
你们这个不洁 渎神美第奇家族
The Medicis - copulators, blasphemers

00:14:58.951 --> 00:15:02.387
正将我们这座城市引向灭亡
corrupting our city.

00:15:02.454 --> 00:15:06.423
我的双眼因看到你而灼痛不已
My eyes burn to look at you!

00:15:13.732 --> 00:15:16.867
你居然让一个疯女人抢走了你的佩刀
You let a mad woman seize your blade.

00:15:16.935 --> 00:15:19.637
我真该处死你
I ought to kill you with it!

00:15:19.705 --> 00:15:21.305
把她带走
Take her away.

00:15:21.373 --> 00:15:23.807
动作轻一点 尊重死者
Carefully and with respect.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.413
你们这些人就赶紧回家吧
The rest of you... go home.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.947
为她的亡灵祷告
Pray for her soul.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.418
快走啊 走
Go on, go!

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.654
天啊 你到底要这些尸骸做什么
What in God's name are you doing with these bodies?

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:53.448
列奥纳多 它们已经开始腐烂了
Leonardo, they're beginning to putrefy.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.774
尸腐味已经弥漫到我的工坊了
And the stench has carried into my studio.

00:15:57.842 --> 00:15:59.343
安德里亚 拜托 你看不出来
Andrea, please, can you not

00:15:59.344 --> 00:16:01.845
我正试图从这里面寻找线索吗
see that I'm trying to pursue something here?

00:16:01.913 --> 00:16:04.081
好吧 你看看这个
Now look at this, look at this.

00:16:04.148 --> 00:16:08.084
非洲 以及欧洲  对吧
Africa...and Europe. Here?

00:16:08.152 --> 00:16:12.121
- 对  - 你看 恰好和这里相符
- Yes. - See how they fit into this.

00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:14.791
欧洲和非洲 在这里还有这里
Europe and Africa, here and here...

00:16:14.858 --> 00:16:16.492
再看看那个犹太人的地图
..And the Jew's map.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.095
这个地方现如今已被分为两块大陆
It can only be where there are now two land masses,

00:16:19.163 --> 00:16:21.999
可它们曾经是一体的
there once was just one.

00:16:25.437 --> 00:16:27.838
随着年岁的推移渐行渐远
Drifted apart over ages.

00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:34.045
还有它们之间 那浩瀚的大西洋
And between them, the great Atlantic.

00:16:34.112 --> 00:16:37.949
《叶之书》想必就在这里 安德里亚
The Book of Leaves has to be here, Andrea...

00:16:38.016 --> 00:16:39.784
沿着这块大陆一路向西
..On this land mass to the West.

00:16:39.851 --> 00:16:44.588
但你甚至都无法确定这块大陆是否真实存在
But you don't even know that this land mass actually exists.

00:16:44.656 --> 00:16:48.126
密特拉教 是一个古代的秘密宗教 在公元前一世纪到公元五世纪强盛
它主要是崇拜密特拉神 是史前文明社会雅利安人曾信拜的神

00:16:48.126 --> 00:16:49.860
"愚人之火"
"Foolish fire".

00:16:49.928 --> 00:16:51.879
正如无知孩童追逐发光的昆虫
Children chasing after luminous insects,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.197
当它们是仙子的灯火
thinking them faerie lights

00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:56.101
被引入沉泥沼泽中无法自拔
and finding themselves neck-deep in swamp-mire.

00:16:56.168 --> 00:16:57.584
我可不是什么无知孩童 安德里亚
Well, I'm not a child, Andrea.

00:16:57.585 --> 00:16:58.703
真的吗 但你全然不顾自己的
Oh, really? And yet you pursue this folly

00:16:58.771 --> 00:17:01.940
正当职责屡现危机 反来追查这等荒唐之事
while your legitimate commissions languish.

00:17:04.043 --> 00:17:05.944
- 大师  大师   - 好吧 怎么了 小子
- Maestro! Maestro! - Yes, what is it, boy?

00:17:06.012 --> 00:17:09.648
多纳蒂夫人看见凡妮莎去了圣安东尼修道院
Signora Donati saw Vanessa leaving for the Convent St Anthony.

00:17:09.715 --> 00:17:11.349
你想说什么
And your point is?

00:17:11.417 --> 00:17:13.585
那里的修女都被恶魔迷了心窍
Demons possess the nuns there!

00:17:13.653 --> 00:17:14.753
我看见过其中一个修女
I saw one of the sisters.

00:17:14.754 --> 00:17:16.154
生生把自己的眼珠子给抠了出来
She stabbed her own eyes out!

00:17:16.222 --> 00:17:18.356
凡妮莎也会堕入魔爪的
Vanessa can fall victim to the demons too!

00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:20.692
目前还没有证明恶魔们能对人造成什么危害
Demons have yet to be proven the cause of anything

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:22.427
好吧 冗长乏味的布道除外
except some rather tedious sermons.

00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:24.929
- 我们得去救她啊   - 闭嘴 尼克
- We need to help her! - Fuck, Nico!

00:17:24.996 --> 00:17:26.605
如果我把所有时间都浪费在调查
If I dropped everything to pursue

00:17:26.606 --> 00:17:28.899
那些破绽百出愚蠢至极的异想天开之上
some ill-conceived and asinine flight of fancy,

00:17:28.967 --> 00:17:31.269
我到头来必然一事无成
I would never get anything done!

00:17:34.473 --> 00:17:36.674
有你的 我记住了
Well, I'll remember that

00:17:36.742 --> 00:17:38.228
下次再叫我或凡妮莎
the next time you decide

00:17:38.229 --> 00:17:41.079
做你的左膀右臂 看我怎么回你
to strap me or Vanessa into your glider wings.

00:17:57.563 --> 00:18:00.398
那暴戾的动作 那癫狂的尖叫
The violence of her movements, her screeching,

00:18:00.466 --> 00:18:02.167
她好像被附身了 洛伦佐
she seemed possessed, Lorenzo.

00:18:02.235 --> 00:18:03.702
我老弟看见一个疯子修女
My brother saw one mad nun

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.705
就认为佛罗伦萨有恶魔四处逍遥作恶
and thinks the Devil is at large in Florence.

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:07.406
不仅如此
It's not just the one.

00:18:07.474 --> 00:18:09.041
据说恶魔的影响力正在扩大
They say the Devil's influence is spreading,

00:18:09.109 --> 00:18:11.545
并定会审判这座城池
and so must be a judgment on this city.

00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:13.447
审判美第奇家族
A judgment on the Medicis.

00:18:13.514 --> 00:18:15.349
人民的意志决定我们的兴衰
We rise and fall on the people's will.

00:18:15.416 --> 00:18:18.151
在找到流言所起的原因之前 无论是否真有恶魔
Until we can assess the cause, demonic or otherwise,

00:18:18.219 --> 00:18:20.286
我们最好先封锁修道院
we'd best seal off the Convent.

00:18:20.354 --> 00:18:22.288
好的 我同意
Yes, agreed.

00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:23.739
此刻我们正与罗马交恶
Given our trouble with Rome,

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.259
不能再让人民质疑我们的虔诚
we don't want our own people questioning our piety.

00:18:26.326 --> 00:18:28.394
让我来处理吧
Let me handle it.

00:18:28.462 --> 00:18:31.764
人们看到那位修女在我的面前自杀
The people beheld this woman kill herself at the sight of me.

00:18:31.832 --> 00:18:34.334
若我调查清楚此事 必能消止流言
If I resolve this, I end the gossips as well.

00:18:34.401 --> 00:18:37.036
我会带上德拉戈内蒂和他手下的官兵
I'll take Dragonetti and a couple of his officers.

00:18:37.104 --> 00:18:40.273
我会查明真相的  我保证
I'll get to the bottom of this. I promise you.

00:18:44.345 --> 00:18:45.612
那就你去吧
Oh, go on, then.

00:18:47.749 --> 00:18:49.016
去啊
Go!

00:18:53.288 --> 00:18:54.543
想说什么就说吧  你看上去
Out with it. You've the

00:18:54.544 --> 00:18:56.891
就像吃了只苍蝇似的
look of having eaten something distasteful.

00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:05.847
可以让我们畅所欲言的地方
If we can speak freely anywhere,

00:19:05.848 --> 00:19:07.936
非这间家族教堂莫属
it's here, in our family chapel.

00:19:08.004 --> 00:19:09.589
梵蒂冈似乎
The Vatican often appears

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.507
对我们的策略了如指掌
to know our strategies just as we employ them.

00:19:12.575 --> 00:19:15.244
他们谋杀了斯福尔扎 终结了我们和米兰的联盟
They murder Sforza to end our alliance with Milan.

00:19:15.311 --> 00:19:17.913
他们要求会面达·芬奇 就在我们雇佣他之后
They ask to meet Da Vinci, just as we hire him.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.890
由此可见 你已经说过了
Understandably, you've suggested

00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:21.483
我们宫廷之中藏有密探
we have a spy within our court.

00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:24.252
但在我们采取更强力的措施
But before we take more aggressive steps

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.288
以斩除这个罗马密探之前
towards rooting out Rome's agent,

00:19:26.355 --> 00:19:29.124
我们还得考虑一些别的因素
I believe there's something else we should consider.

00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:34.497
你娶了克拉丽丝 同罗马联姻
You married Clarice to build ties with Rome.

00:19:34.564 --> 00:19:36.131
她的家人都还在那里
She still has family there.

00:19:36.199 --> 00:19:39.068
你是想说我的妻子正试图置我们于死地吗
Are you're suggesting that my wife is trying to destroy us?

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:40.737
我不是说她试图怎样
Not trying, no.

00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:43.807
她有可能会无意地将这里的事情写进家信之中
But she may be guilelessly expressing things in her letters.

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:45.291
也许她没有意识到...
She may be unaware...

00:19:45.292 --> 00:19:47.878
克拉丽丝智慧超群 她对我忠心不二
Clarice is exceptional and she is loyal.

00:19:50.448 --> 00:19:53.817
"即便人生坎坷陡峭 仍当保持沉着思考"
"When life's path is steep, keep your mind even."

00:19:53.884 --> 00:19:58.120
这不是我小的时候 你教给我的吗
You taught me that when I was a boy.

00:19:58.187 --> 00:20:00.322
请保持沉着思考
Keep your mind even.

00:20:05.095 --> 00:20:06.695
先是修道院恶魔事发
First this crisis at the Convent,

00:20:06.763 --> 00:20:08.631
又是宫廷之中有密探不忠
and now a traitor in our midst.

00:20:09.866 --> 00:20:13.102
无论采取怎样的手段 一定要抓到那个密探
Take whatever steps you must to find our spy.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.570
速战速决
Do it quickly.

00:20:26.817 --> 00:20:27.817
前面有人
There's someone ahead.

00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:33.689
- 我来处理吧   - 大人 请交由我来
- I'll handle this. - Signor, I must insist.

00:20:33.757 --> 00:20:35.524
不过是个女孩子 队长
It's just a girl, Captain.

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:46.535
坚强点儿  伯蒂诺
Steel yourself, Bertino.

00:20:46.603 --> 00:20:49.972
修女小姐 可以听到我说话吗
Sister, can you hear me?

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.707
我们是来帮助你的
We're here to help you.

00:20:51.775 --> 00:20:53.509
我是朱利亚诺·德·美第奇...
I am Giuliano de Medici...

00:21:03.386 --> 00:21:04.786
别下马
Stay with the horses.

00:21:14.497 --> 00:21:17.399
把她抱到我的马上 绑起来
Sling her onto my horse, tie her down.

00:21:17.467 --> 00:21:18.634
我们把她带回修道院去
We'll take her to the Convent.

00:21:18.702 --> 00:21:22.805
小心
Look out!

00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:29.945
美第奇家族的铁蹄之下
How many deaths of the faithful

00:21:30.013 --> 00:21:31.847
还将沾染多少信徒的鲜血
will be laid at the feet of the Medicis?

00:22:10.322 --> 00:22:11.822
伯蒂诺
Bertino!

00:22:34.581 --> 00:22:36.182
德拉戈内蒂
Dragonetti.

00:23:06.545 --> 00:23:10.414
深渊与深渊响应 愿此能拯救我们脱离罪海
Abyssus abyssum invocat. Sed libera nos a Malo.

00:23:10.482 --> 00:23:12.717
深渊与深渊响应
Abyssus abyssum invocat.

00:23:12.785 --> 00:23:14.452
"深渊与深渊响应"
"Hell calls to hell".

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:16.988
一步失足 万劫不复
One misstep leads to another.

00:23:17.056 --> 00:23:18.936
恶魔也因而循迹踏上我们的门阶
That's what's brought the Devil to our doorstep.

00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:22.427
你和你的哥哥违背了神的意愿
You and your brother have denied God's will.

00:23:22.494 --> 00:23:24.162
你们就不怕为此遭报应吗
Did you think there wouldn't be a cost?

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.132
诚然 报应不轻
Well, the cost is dear, to be sure.

00:23:30.002 --> 00:23:33.638
但我依然不信 是上帝造成了这一切
But I'm not yet convinced it was the Lord who levied it.

00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:34.973
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

00:23:35.041 --> 00:23:36.374
我只是来找一个朋友的
I've come looking for a friend.

00:23:45.018 --> 00:23:46.652
凡妮莎  嘘
Vanessa! Ssh!

00:23:46.719 --> 00:23:50.522
嘘  嘘
Ssh! Ssh!

00:23:55.262 --> 00:23:57.764
我认识这女人
I know this woman.

00:23:57.831 --> 00:24:01.835
她曾是我们中的一员  也是名修女
She was one of us, a fellow Sister,

00:24:01.903 --> 00:24:05.305
而这个无耻之徒许诺给她一段更灿烂多姿的生活
then this lecher sold her promises of a more colorful life.

00:24:07.008 --> 00:24:11.845
烧 烧起来了 我体内有团火在灼烧着我
Burning, burning, there's a fire inside me.

00:24:11.912 --> 00:24:13.112
这个可怜的姑娘本是来援助我们的
The poor girl came to aid us

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.947
却也像其他人一样被附身了
but was struck down like the others.

00:24:14.947 --> 00:24:18.160
她被附身多久了?
How long has this possession been going on?

00:24:18.385 --> 00:24:20.453
这跟你什么关系
What business is it of yours?

00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:22.822
你信奉上帝吗
Are you for God?

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.391
我知道你在工坊做的那些事儿
I know what goes on in your workshop.

00:24:25.459 --> 00:24:28.428
裸体的模型 肉欲的淫乐
The nude modeling, the carnal relations,

00:24:28.496 --> 00:24:31.832
以科学之名亵渎尸骸
the cadavers you debase in the name of science.

00:24:31.899 --> 00:24:34.768
你的作为与他们的德行相悖
Your endeavors condemn all they touch.

00:24:34.835 --> 00:24:37.370
我们不需要你的任何帮助
We want none of your assistance.

00:24:37.438 --> 00:24:39.773
还有你的 美第奇大人
Nor yours, Signor Medici.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.610
唯有虔诚的祷告和忏罪才可终止这一切
Only fervid prayer and penitence will stop this.

00:24:43.678 --> 00:24:46.346
工匠  方便谈谈么
Artista. A word with you.

00:24:54.689 --> 00:24:58.692
这不是你该做的吧 不是吗
Others are paid to do that, no?

00:25:00.728 --> 00:25:03.330
我的父亲教育我说 无论你的经营如何
My father taught me no matter the business surrounding you,

00:25:03.398 --> 00:25:04.898
都不可没有自己的计量
never lose the count.

00:25:06.067 --> 00:25:09.337
因为美第奇家族最主要的身份是银行家
For the Medicis are bankers before all else.

00:25:09.404 --> 00:25:12.940
他生前真是个缜密的聪明人
A wise man. Taken before his time.

00:25:13.008 --> 00:25:14.642
皮耶罗·迪·科西莫·德·美第奇
(Piero di Cosimo de' Medici) 常被称作痛风者 (意大利语:Piero "il Gottoso")

00:25:14.709 --> 00:25:15.808
无论生前有多少功绩
For everything he was,

00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:17.678
在他死后人们记得最清的却是他的疾病
he's remembered most for his sickness.

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:19.046
他同样被尊崇为一名伟大的父亲
He is honored as a father.

00:25:19.114 --> 00:25:20.678
"伟大的洛伦佐"的父亲
To "Lorenzo the Magnificent".

00:25:20.679 --> 00:25:21.950
只是现在大家这么说罢了
For now.

00:25:22.018 --> 00:25:24.987
不久后大家便会给我起个别名
Soon they may call me by other names.

00:25:25.054 --> 00:25:26.367
没准我会成为一名
Perhaps I'll be the banker

00:25:26.368 --> 00:25:29.490
帕齐家族（The Pazzi family）是古老高贵的托斯卡纳贵族家庭
他们放弃了自己的头衔以便于家族成员被选为公职
在十五世纪他们主要的贸易活动是银行业

00:25:28.558 --> 00:25:30.054
或是一名将撒旦之怒火
or the heretic who incurs

00:25:30.055 --> 00:25:32.628
招引至佛罗伦萨无辜民众之躯的异教徒
the wrath of Satan on Florence's innocents.

00:25:32.695 --> 00:25:34.929
我的爱人 你该休息一会了
My beloved, you must get some rest.

00:25:38.233 --> 00:25:41.669
今天我想把贝奇遣走
Today I thought of sending Becchi away.

00:25:41.737 --> 00:25:45.973
- 什么  为什么   - 我很爱他
- What? Why? - I love him.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.008
他于我而言就如第二位父亲
He's been a second father to me.

00:25:48.076 --> 00:25:52.412
但 但他竟然怀疑你
But, but he questioned you.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.648
他觉得你有可能在
He thought that you could be

00:25:54.716 --> 00:25:58.252
无意中向你的家族 向罗马
mistakenly sharing information with your family.

00:25:58.319 --> 00:25:59.453
泄露情报
With Rome.

00:25:59.521 --> 00:26:01.388
你是觉得他的质问会冒犯到我吗
Do you think asking would offend me?

00:26:01.456 --> 00:26:04.024
- 但这冒犯到我了   - 不该如此
- It offends me. - It shouldn't.

00:26:04.092 --> 00:26:07.060
我们生活在这样一个自私的时代
We live in craven times.

00:26:07.128 --> 00:26:08.273
一个人可以烧掉一座城池
A man would have a city

00:26:08.274 --> 00:26:10.464
只为让自己的日子过得更舒心些
in flames to make his life more comfortable.

00:26:12.167 --> 00:26:16.370
谨记要小心行事 洛伦佐
You don't come at a snake from the front, Lorenzo.

00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:20.775
倘若我真的是密探 你将此事告知于我 便是失策
If I were one, bringing this up would be pointless.

00:26:20.843 --> 00:26:23.744
这会将你置于不利之地
It would make you vulnerable.

00:26:23.812 --> 00:26:27.014
你可以未经我的允许 直接拿我的家信看
You simply should have had my letters read without my knowledge.

00:26:27.082 --> 00:26:31.085
在我最近一封家信中 我写到
In my last letter to my family, I told them this:

00:26:31.152 --> 00:26:37.457
"世上无人能比我更忠实于洛伦佐"
"There are none more loyal to Lorenzo than I."

00:26:37.525 --> 00:26:44.998
"若有朝一日 洛伦佐败落 他人或还可继续生活
"There are others who, if Lorenzo fell, would move on.

00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:47.634
"而我 则再无生活可言"
"I could never Move on."

00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:50.470
我明白你有时需要逃离 洛伦佐
I understand your need for escape, Lorenzo.

00:26:50.538 --> 00:26:53.573
暂时逃离责任的束缚
To feel apart from your responsibility.

00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:57.244
你可以偶尔逃离  但之后 你必须回来
You can have that escape. But you do have to come back.

00:27:07.922 --> 00:27:12.493
你总要回来
You must always come back.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.832
拿好你的枪 达·芬奇
Attend to your guns, Da Vinci.

00:27:17.899 --> 00:27:20.234
我被训练过如何驾驭它
I've been tasked to handle this matter.

00:27:20.302 --> 00:27:21.936
你现在可是在做着万人敬仰的活计呢
And you're doing an admirable job.

00:27:22.003 --> 00:27:25.139
我听说你在去修道院的途中杀了一名修女
I hear you slaughtered one of the poor Sisters on the way in.

00:27:25.207 --> 00:27:28.275
- 那是个意外  - 这只是无能者的说辞
- It was an accident. - Incompetence often is.

00:27:28.343 --> 00:27:29.877
你竟敢这样说
How dare you!

00:27:36.184 --> 00:27:37.952
站着别动
Stay put.

00:27:42.757 --> 00:27:45.325
你就是这样向洛伦佐证明自己的能力的吗
This is how you prove your worth to Lorenzo?

00:27:45.393 --> 00:27:47.628
杀掉了他的战争工程师?
By killing his war engineer?

00:27:52.367 --> 00:27:56.804
告诉我 朱利亚诺  你是怎么计划的
Tell me something, Giuliano. What is your plan?

00:27:56.872 --> 00:27:59.807
封锁这座修道院直至恶灵退散
To seal off this place until the evil spirits retreat.

00:27:59.875 --> 00:28:02.410
你就坚信是恶魔附身 而不去调查别的原因吗
You won't inquire into anything other than possession?

00:28:02.478 --> 00:28:03.946
我当然要调查
Of course I will.

00:28:03.971 --> 00:28:06.048
那么 请大发慈悲地告诉我们您还有什么方案吧
Well, grace us with your alternate theories then.

00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:10.018
- 请把   - 疾病 或许是这个
- Please. - Disease. Perhaps.

00:28:10.086 --> 00:28:12.387
- 对   - 淋巴结核 瘟疫
- Right. - Scrofula, plague.

00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:15.324
我还从未见过传播如此之快威力如此之大的疾病
I know of no disease that can ravage its host this quickly.

00:28:15.392 --> 00:28:17.092
那你说是什么
Well, what, then?

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.761
在我们认定此为恶魔的杰作之前
Before we accept the Devil's work,

00:28:19.829 --> 00:28:22.798
就不能先排除一下一些世俗常见的可能原因吗
shouldn't we first eliminate the more profane causes?

00:28:22.866 --> 00:28:24.967
检验一下是不是黑豹第蘑菇
Consider panther cap mushrooms.

00:28:25.034 --> 00:28:27.736
据我所知这种蘑菇轻则致幻 重则致死
They're known to cause hallucinations, even death.

00:28:27.804 --> 00:28:29.738
好了 来看看大家都找着些什么
Right, let's see what we've found.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.211
不 不是 不是
No, no, no,

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.648
不是 不是 不是
no, no, no.

00:28:42.218 --> 00:28:43.619
这些都不是毒菇
None of these are the culprit.

00:28:43.686 --> 00:28:46.989
好吧 我们的下一目标 狼蛛
Right, next on our list, wolf spiders.

00:28:47.056 --> 00:28:48.857
狼蛛科的唾液具有毒性
The poisonous bite of the Lycosidae.

00:28:48.925 --> 00:28:52.060
可导致身体发狂不能自控 即毒蛛症
That can cause a hysterical state of movement called Tarantism.

00:28:52.128 --> 00:28:53.796
等一下
Wait!

00:28:53.863 --> 00:28:57.166
唉 这不是我们要找的罪魁祸首
Alas, that's not the villain we seek.

00:28:57.233 --> 00:29:00.002
那现在该怎样 臭画匠
Then what now, scribbler?

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.204
欣赏一些艺术品吧
Some art appreciation, I think.

00:29:05.208 --> 00:29:07.776
这里怎么可能找得到致毒物
What possible contaminant can be found in here?

00:29:07.844 --> 00:29:10.379
考虑到修女们生活在色彩艳丽的画作中
Considering the florid images the Sisters live amidst,

00:29:10.447 --> 00:29:12.872
再加上外行的绘画技巧...
not to mention the amateurish technique...

00:29:12.873 --> 00:29:13.816
陈列在这里
on display here,

00:29:13.884 --> 00:29:18.854
难怪这些受染者坚信自己被恶魔附身
is it any wonder the afflicted believe themselves possessed?

00:29:18.922 --> 00:29:20.523
你也疯了吗
Have you gone mad too?

00:29:20.591 --> 00:29:23.526
我想这些颜料中含有太多水银
I thought the pigments might contain too much mercury.

00:29:23.593 --> 00:29:24.960
- 但不是   - 够了 达·芬奇
- But no. - Enough, Da Vinci.

00:29:25.028 --> 00:29:26.696
当你开始舔画时
When you start licking paintings

00:29:26.763 --> 00:29:28.931
我想真的该承认这里确有恶魔了
I think it's time to accept that the Devil is here.

00:29:28.999 --> 00:29:30.733
来自罗马的骑手
Riders from Rome!

00:29:32.936 --> 00:29:37.073
仅此一次 朱利亚诺 也许你是对的
For once, Giuliano, you may be correct.

00:29:41.478 --> 00:29:43.246
格伦瓦尔德队长
Captain Grunwald.

00:29:43.313 --> 00:29:45.749
朱利亚诺·德·美第奇
Giuliano de Medici.

00:29:45.816 --> 00:29:47.850
一如既往的帅气啊
Pretty as always.

00:29:47.918 --> 00:29:49.619
我还以为经历了上次在佛罗伦萨的遭遇之后
I'd have thought you loath to return,

00:29:49.686 --> 00:29:52.388
您都不愿意回来了呢
after your last mission to Florence.

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:57.127
我们是跟随莫丘利大人一起
We bring help to the dear Sisters,

00:29:57.194 --> 00:29:59.262
来帮助亲爱的修女们的
in the person of Prefect Mercuri.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.131
卢波·莫丘利?
Lupo Mercuri?

00:30:01.198 --> 00:30:03.233
梵蒂冈秘密卷宗的保管人?
Curator of the Vatican's Secret Archives?

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.437
今天 我作为圣礼教会长官来此
Today, I come as Prefect for the Sacred Congregation of Rites.

00:30:07.504 --> 00:30:10.039
感谢您善发仁慈之心来此援助 大人
Your offer of assistance is gracious, Prefect,

00:30:10.107 --> 00:30:12.342
但修道院院长完全能够胜任
but the Abbess is quite able

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:14.577
带领教徒为修女们祈祷的职责
to lead the prayers for her flock.

00:30:14.645 --> 00:30:19.515
我的任务是来此举行神圣的驱魔仪式
My orders are to execute the holy rites for demonic exorcism.

00:30:19.583 --> 00:30:20.955
我不会丢下这些善良的修女
I have no plans to leave

00:30:20.956 --> 00:30:23.586
听凭你们这群骗子的摆布
the good sisters at the mercy of the Deceiver.

00:30:23.654 --> 00:30:25.488
你对恶魔可真是无所不知啊
And are you so attuned to the infernal,

00:30:25.555 --> 00:30:28.057
即使远在罗马也可感知到他们的水深火热
you could sense their problems all the way from Rome?

00:30:28.124 --> 00:30:30.292
我们几天前发出了求助 画匠
We sent for aid days ago, painter.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.729
在紧急时刻我们可不会拒绝救世主的帮助
We dare not reject Christ's warriors in our hour of need.

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:45.476
- 侄子   - 教皇陛下
- Nephew. - Your Grace.

00:30:45.544 --> 00:30:47.411
修道院的事进展如何
How goes the business at the Convent?

00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:49.747
恐怕伤亡人数在增加
I fear the casualties mount.

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:52.483
上帝往往需要我们做出牺牲
The Lord often requires sacrifice.

00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:54.785
美第奇家族违背上帝的旨意
The Medicis crossed the Lord,

00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:57.454
拒绝我们对比萨大主教的任命
refusing to appoint our Archbishop in Pisa,

00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:00.256
还雇佣了一个战争工程师
employing a war engineer.

00:31:00.324 --> 00:31:03.093
摧毁洛伦佐和他所有的拥护者
It is God's will to break Lorenzo

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:04.794
是主的意愿
and all who support him.

00:31:04.862 --> 00:31:08.932
除了关于达·芬奇的事情  其他的我都同意
With the possible exception of Da Vinci, I agree with you.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.369
卢克雷齐娅·多纳蒂把他迷得神魂颠倒
Lucrezia Donati has him tied up between her thighs,

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:15.939
他和美第奇家族的关系不怎么牢固
his alliance with the Medicis is a fragile one.

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:20.644
他制造的那些武器 都可以被我们所用
Those weapons he makes, they could all be ours.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.715
那达·芬奇还和其他人有关系吗
And what of Da Vinci's other alliances?

00:31:24.783 --> 00:31:26.850
他是否支持密特拉教徒?
Has he not sided with the Sons of Mithras?

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:29.320
达·芬奇能将《叶之书》带给我们
Da Vinci can deliver us The Book of Leaves.

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:32.656
一切迹象表明 此书正在佛罗伦萨
All signs point to it being in Florence,

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:36.393
达·芬奇能助我们揭开那段无人知晓的秘密
and then he can aid in unlocking its unparalleled knowledge.

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:42.665
毫无疑问 主愿我们接受他
Surely, the Lord will is that we embrace him.

00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:45.234
用你来告诉我主的意愿吗
Do you tell me what the Lord wills?

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.204
当然不用 神父
Of course not, Father.

00:31:48.272 --> 00:31:49.839
是圣父
Holy Father.

00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:03.918
去想办法
Find a way, then.

00:32:03.986 --> 00:32:07.722
让达·芬奇成为我们的人 若你乐意的话
Make this Da Vinci ours, if it amuses you.

00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:12.727
对了 里拉里奥 你的女奴
Oh, Riario, your slave girl.

00:32:12.795 --> 00:32:14.429
那个阿比西尼亚人
The Abyssinian.

00:32:14.497 --> 00:32:16.131
我想让她今晚服侍我
I want her for tonight.

00:32:19.302 --> 00:32:22.337
别急呀  明早就把她还给你
Don't fret. You'll have her back in the morning.

00:32:39.489 --> 00:32:40.990
谢谢你 古尔伯托
Thank you, Gualberto.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.431
洛伦佐?
Lorenzo?

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:52.435
不是  我知道他是怎么召唤你的
No. I know how he summons you.

00:32:52.502 --> 00:32:57.273
古尔伯托 四轮马车 玫瑰
Gualberto, the carriage, the rose.

00:32:58.375 --> 00:33:00.276
他们都在这幅画上
They're all up there.

00:33:00.344 --> 00:33:01.945
洛伦佐 他的父亲
Lorenzo, his father.

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:03.580
他的祖父 科西莫
His grandfather, Cosimo.

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.415
朱利亚诺 他的猞猁
Giuliano, his lynx.

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:11.221
他的姐妹们 我 贝奇
His sisters, me, Becchi.

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:14.925
甚至连斯福尔扎公爵那头蠢猪都在
Even that pig Duke Sforza.

00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:17.862
因为他曾对于佛罗伦萨很重要
Because he was important to Florence.

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:24.501
洛伦佐没在召唤我
Lorenzo doesn't summon me.

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:27.004
他在召唤你
Oh, but he does.

00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:28.639
当然 不总是召唤你
It hasn't always been you.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.207
洛伦佐还有别的消遣方式
Lorenzo's had other diversions.

00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:33.811
你想要我怎么样?  和他保持距离吗?
Well, what do you want? For me to stay away from him?

00:33:33.879 --> 00:33:36.448
我爱他  也爱这座城市
I love him. And I love this city.

00:33:38.551 --> 00:33:41.253
或许因为 他 就是这座城市
Perhaps because he is this city.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.054
你知道 我们必须取胜
You see, we have to prevail.

00:33:43.122 --> 00:33:45.524
你认为我阻碍了取胜之路?
And do you think me an impediment to that end?

00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:47.993
你不可四处炫耀你的不耻私情
You cannot be as brazen with your affections.

00:33:48.061 --> 00:33:50.295
在公共场合不可
Not in public.

00:33:51.498 --> 00:33:55.033
在我们宫廷之中藏有密探
There is a conspirator in our court.

00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:58.203
正如我们所说 洛伦佐将继续排除嫌疑
As we speak, Lorenzo continues to eliminate suspects

00:33:58.271 --> 00:34:00.639
严设圈套
and draws the noose tighter.

00:34:00.707 --> 00:34:02.908
他们定会抓住密探并处死他
They will find the traitor and execute him.

00:34:02.975 --> 00:34:04.028
但在此之前
But until then, any

00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:06.745
洛伦佐的所有弱点都可能被利用
vulnerability against Lorenzo could be exploited.

00:34:06.813 --> 00:34:09.248
也许会有人用你作威胁来对抗他
You could be used as leverage against him.

00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:13.752
你的作用便是被他消遣
You are a distraction. That's your function.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.354
我可以容忍
I will tolerate that.

00:34:15.422 --> 00:34:19.092
但我不能容忍你成为他的一个弱点
But I will not tolerate you becoming a vulnerability.

00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:25.232
我走后等五分钟再离开
Wait five minutes after I leave.

00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:32.505
克拉丽丝 我知道你爱他
Clarice, I know you love him.

00:34:32.573 --> 00:34:35.474
你怎么就能忍受与我同在一室
How can you even stand to look at me?

00:34:35.542 --> 00:34:38.243
因为我知道你永远无法出现在那幅画中
Because I know you will never be up on that wall.

00:34:43.282 --> 00:34:45.617
啊 夫人
Ah, Signora.

00:34:45.684 --> 00:34:47.585
在离开前能否问您一句
Might I have a word before you depart?

00:34:47.653 --> 00:34:50.689
您和您的丈夫明天在家吗
Are you and your husband at home tomorrow?

00:34:50.756 --> 00:34:53.891
我问询您最近的行踪 至关重要
It's vital I question you about any recent travels.

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:56.294
- 我们的行踪?   - 请原谅我的无礼
- Our travels? - Forgive my indelicacy,

00:34:56.362 --> 00:35:00.699
但洛伦佐要求我追踪进出宫廷的
but Lorenzo requests I track the comings and goings of everyone

00:35:00.767 --> 00:35:02.869
每一个人
with access to the palace.

00:35:02.936 --> 00:35:05.738
由于时局敏感 我们不能有例外
Given these vexing times, we can't make exceptions.

00:35:05.806 --> 00:35:06.982
当然
Absolutely.

00:35:07.007 --> 00:35:09.169
尼可拉和我都会尽力帮助你的
Niccolo and I will assist you in any way that we can.

00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:12.511
太好了  那就明天中午见
Excellent. Tomorrow noon then?

00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:15.581
好的  祝你愉快 真蒂利
Yes. Good day, Gentile.

00:35:26.993 --> 00:35:31.430
古尔伯托 今晚再来接我
Gualberto, you shall retrieve me again this evening.

00:35:31.498 --> 00:35:33.866
洛伦佐要求我来
Lorenzo requires my presence.

00:35:44.846 --> 00:35:47.381
我要驱逐你 可憎的恶魔
I cast you out, infernal adversary!

00:35:47.448 --> 00:35:49.350
离开奥丽埃纳修女的身躯
Begone from our Sister Oriana,

00:35:49.417 --> 00:35:51.385
离开所有上帝的造物
from all made in the image of God

00:35:51.453 --> 00:35:54.022
离开因基督的血而得到救赎的人
and redeemed by the precious blood of the divine Lamb.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.391
至高无上的神命令你
The most high God commands you!

00:35:56.459 --> 00:35:58.827
- 罗马的男人   - 至高无上的神命令你
- Man of Rome. - The Most High God commands you.

00:35:58.895 --> 00:36:00.212
我知道你为何而来
I know why you came.

00:36:00.213 --> 00:36:01.530
永恒的上帝之道创造肉身
Eternal Word of God made flesh.

00:36:01.598 --> 00:36:02.678
我知道你在渴求什么
I know what you crave.

00:36:02.703 --> 00:36:05.435
神圣而神秘的十字架命令你
The sacred mystery of the cross commands you.

00:36:05.535 --> 00:36:07.368
我知道你在渴求什么
I know what you crave.

00:36:07.369 --> 00:36:09.071
圣洁的圣母玛利亚命令你
The exalted Virgin Mary commands you.

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:11.540
你脑中所想只有交媾
All you think about is fucking.

00:36:11.608 --> 00:36:14.743
我代永活之神命令你 我以真神之名命令你
I adjure you by the living God, by the true God,

00:36:14.811 --> 00:36:18.514
停止你对这名女性的欺骗
cease your deception of this woman!

00:36:18.582 --> 00:36:20.750
滚开
Begone!

00:36:20.817 --> 00:36:22.585
- 滚开   - 莫丘利大人
- Begone! - Prefect Mercuri!

00:36:22.652 --> 00:36:24.119
安静
Silence!

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:33.696
我命令你 离开
I command you, begone!

00:36:33.764 --> 00:36:36.132
在她将死瞬间
The moments before she died,

00:36:36.199 --> 00:36:39.235
我在她的眼中看见了上帝之光
I saw the light of God in her eyes.

00:36:39.303 --> 00:36:41.370
她得到救赎了
She is saved.

00:36:43.007 --> 00:36:47.143
请教一下 大人  你在驱魔生涯中
Tell me something, Prefect. In all your time doing this,

00:36:47.211 --> 00:36:50.213
可有遇到过无法驱逐的恶魔?
have you ever met a demon that you couldn't expel?

00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:52.615
没有
No.

00:36:52.683 --> 00:36:54.483
"从阴霾走向光明"
"Ex umbra in solem".

00:36:54.551 --> 00:36:56.419
"从阴霾走向光明"
"From Shadow into the Light".

00:36:56.487 --> 00:37:00.455
出自秘密卷宗的警句
Epigram of the Secret Archives.

00:37:05.394 --> 00:37:08.829
我在哪  我在做什么?
Where am I? What am I doing?

00:37:08.897 --> 00:37:10.764
你在修道院里
You're at the Convent.

00:37:10.832 --> 00:37:13.634
你在修道院里
You're at the Convent.

00:37:13.701 --> 00:37:16.603
- 但我为你离开了这里   - 你回来了
- But I left it for you. - You returned.

00:37:16.671 --> 00:37:21.976
你回来帮助你的朋友们
You came back to aid your friends.

00:37:22.044 --> 00:37:25.246
你骗我 列奥纳多
You lied, Leonardo.

00:37:25.314 --> 00:37:29.850
你向我许诺会有奇迹
You promised me wonders.

00:37:29.918 --> 00:37:34.989
你说我们会飞翔  你说我们会如太阳般闪耀
You said we'd fly. You said we'd burn like the sun,

00:37:35.056 --> 00:37:39.026
但你的世界根本没有太阳
but there's no sun in your world.

00:37:39.094 --> 00:37:43.664
只有寒冷和阴霾
There's only coldness and shadows.

00:37:43.731 --> 00:37:46.599
冷静
Calm yourself.

00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:48.901
你只是病了
You've taken ill.

00:37:48.969 --> 00:37:52.138
你是那么聪明
You're so smart,

00:37:52.206 --> 00:37:54.474
你是那么美丽
you're so beautiful,

00:37:54.542 --> 00:38:04.217
可我们只是你的玩具 是吗
but we're just toys to you, aren't we?

00:38:04.285 --> 00:38:07.621
我想该开始净化这可怜的灵魂了
I think it is time to cleanse this dear soul as well.

00:38:07.688 --> 00:38:10.957
别碰她  你要是敢
Don't touch her. Don't you...

00:38:11.025 --> 00:38:15.061
应该给她一个自己抗争的机会
Surely she deserves a chance to fight this herself.

00:38:15.129 --> 00:38:19.498
只要再一天
Just one more day.

00:38:19.566 --> 00:38:21.901
以上帝之名
In God's name.

00:38:21.968 --> 00:38:24.437
那就到黎明吧
Till dawn, then.

00:38:24.505 --> 00:38:26.473
如果到早上你还没法解决
If you cannot solve this by morning,

00:38:26.541 --> 00:38:29.242
我们就必须将这恶魔灼烧致死
we must burn this evil out of them.

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:45.426
愚人之火
Foolish fire.

00:38:52.835 --> 00:38:55.804
不要啊
No!

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.779
我要为你而飞 列奥 飞向太阳
I'm going to fly for you, Leo, fly to the sun.

00:39:32.774 --> 00:39:34.761
你现在在佛罗伦萨的土地上
You're on Florentine soil,

00:39:34.762 --> 00:39:38.279
你这个卑鄙可耻的废物 给我快滚  马上
you sheep-biting scut and I want you out. Now.

00:39:38.346 --> 00:39:40.982
现在没有你哥哥做后盾
Tough talk from the golden boy...

00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:43.050
你这金童说话口气还真横
..Without your brother to back it up.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.066
没关系  没多久
No matter. It won't be

00:39:46.067 --> 00:39:48.256
你们俩都要一起滚出这里
long till the both of you are run out of town.

00:39:48.323 --> 00:39:50.357
- 你怎么知道呢   - 很简单
- How do you figure that? - Simple.

00:39:50.425 --> 00:39:54.161
罗马有更多的人  主和他们同在
Rome has more men. And the Lord on its side.

00:39:54.229 --> 00:39:56.530
我们有十辆管风琴炮车
Well, we've got ten pipe organ muskets

00:39:56.598 --> 00:40:01.568
一分钟可以发三十三轮
capable of firing 33 rounds a minute on ours.

00:40:01.636 --> 00:40:04.171
十辆吗
Ten guns?

00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:06.908
幸好知道了 谢谢啊
Good to know, thank you for that.

00:40:23.192 --> 00:40:25.059
我自己去就好
I'll be fine on my own.

00:40:25.127 --> 00:40:27.728
如您所愿 夫人
As you wish, Signora.

00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:29.931
我们要开始排除嫌疑者了
We're starting to eliminate suspects.

00:40:29.999 --> 00:40:32.633
一些记账人 厨子
Some of the counters, the cooks.

00:40:32.701 --> 00:40:34.769
嫌疑范围已经缩小
The circle of suspicion grows smaller.

00:40:34.836 --> 00:40:37.105
大部分人是忠诚的
Most will prove loyal.

00:40:37.172 --> 00:40:38.873
总有一人会露出马脚
One will slip.

00:40:38.941 --> 00:40:40.975
这样我们就能逮到他了
And then we'll have him.

00:41:09.039 --> 00:41:10.439
我没叫你来啊
I didn't send for you.

00:41:10.507 --> 00:41:14.343
我觉得你叫了  我感受到了
I think you did. I felt it.

00:41:15.612 --> 00:41:18.714
我正在为国事烦忧
Matters of state obsess me.

00:41:18.782 --> 00:41:19.982
请你离开
Please go.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.685
他们都看见我来了
There are those who saw me arrive -

00:41:22.753 --> 00:41:26.722
古尔伯托  夜巡官
Gualberto... Officers of the Night.

00:41:28.058 --> 00:41:31.127
他们都知道我只为你而来
And they know I only come here for you.

00:41:31.195 --> 00:41:34.630
他们也许会认为我们结束得...
They may think that you finished with me...

00:41:34.698 --> 00:41:36.098
太早了
prematurely.

00:41:36.166 --> 00:41:39.035
我让他们想什么 他们才会想什么
They'll think what I'll have them think.

00:41:39.103 --> 00:41:40.470
我不想让你在这里
I don't want you here.

00:41:40.538 --> 00:41:43.040
不
No.

00:41:43.107 --> 00:41:44.475
你当然不想
Of course you don't.

00:42:38.196 --> 00:42:39.763
你很烦躁
You're troubled.

00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:43.133
告诉我为什么
Tell me what it is.

00:42:43.201 --> 00:42:47.037
是因为密探吗
Is it the spy?

00:42:47.105 --> 00:42:49.640
你的妻子
Your wife.

00:42:49.707 --> 00:42:53.577
她今天早上招我过去
She summoned me this morning.

00:42:53.645 --> 00:42:55.746
- 我会找她谈   - 不 请不要
- I'll have words with her. - No, please don't.

00:42:55.813 --> 00:42:59.482
她找我只是关心你的安全
Her actions were only out of concern for your safety.

00:43:01.519 --> 00:43:05.121
亲爱的 谁都有可能是密探
My love, this traitor could be anyone,

00:43:05.189 --> 00:43:07.324
和你再亲近的人也可能有嫌疑
no matter how close they are to you.

00:43:07.392 --> 00:43:09.225
克拉丽丝的怀疑有理有据
Clarice's suspicions are justified.

00:43:09.293 --> 00:43:12.062
你的调查要做到一人不漏
You can't let your investigation overlook anyone.

00:43:12.129 --> 00:43:14.431
即使是你最相信的人 也不要放过
Search even those you suspect the least,

00:43:14.499 --> 00:43:17.100
因为危机可能潜伏在任何地方
for the threat may reside anywhere -

00:43:17.168 --> 00:43:19.769
甚至在你自己的家中
even in your own home.

00:43:37.655 --> 00:43:39.556
大师 我都吃了20个了  我可以不吃了吗
Maestro, that's 20. Can I stop now?

00:43:39.623 --> 00:43:41.097
就点酒 全咽下去
Wash it all down.

00:43:41.098 --> 00:43:42.459
你干嘛让我又吃又喝的
Why are you making me do this?

00:43:42.526 --> 00:43:45.829
我们已经排除了偶然因素
We've eliminated accidental causes.

00:43:45.896 --> 00:43:50.100
因此 只剩下一种可能 即有人刻意投毒
That leaves only intentional contamination.

00:43:50.167 --> 00:43:52.787
酒和薄脆饼都被投毒了吗
The wine and wafers are poisoned?

00:43:52.788 --> 00:43:53.770
显然没有
Apparently not.

00:43:53.838 --> 00:43:57.040
我只是怀疑
It was a thought.

00:43:57.108 --> 00:43:59.209
难道没有可能是恶魔作祟吗
Is it not possible demons are the cause?

00:43:59.276 --> 00:44:00.910
这有悖常理
It goes against logic.

00:44:00.978 --> 00:44:05.615
上帝惩罚他的信徒 却不伤害咱们这些异教徒
God punishes his admirers, and leaves heathens like us unscathed?

00:44:05.683 --> 00:44:07.383
这里面一定有阴谋
This has the makings of a plot.

00:44:07.451 --> 00:44:09.719
装神弄鬼 恫吓生灵
Invoke the Devil, make people afraid,

00:44:09.787 --> 00:44:14.123
一但恐惧丛生 他们便不再质疑
and when they're afraid, they stop asking questions.

00:44:14.191 --> 00:44:15.825
不 这不是骗子的伎俩
No, this isn't the work of the Deceiver,

00:44:15.893 --> 00:44:18.727
这是一种反攻
this is a counter-attack.

00:44:18.795 --> 00:44:20.763
是罗马造成的此次附身事件
Rome is inducing this possession.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.898
我就知道
I know it.

00:44:22.966 --> 00:44:26.169
我只是  不知道他们怎么做到的
I just... I don't know how.

00:44:32.543 --> 00:44:33.643
贝尔蒂诺
Bertino!

00:44:33.711 --> 00:44:37.180
I - n - r - I
I - n - r - I.

00:44:37.247 --> 00:44:40.416
我将救世主十字架上的字母刻于他的颈上
I carved the letters from our Savior's cross into his neck,

00:44:40.484 --> 00:44:43.286
来驱赶恶魔
driving out the demons.

00:44:43.353 --> 00:44:48.591
接下来 我该拯救你们谁呢
Which of you will I save next?

00:44:48.659 --> 00:44:50.293
- 恶魔   - 不是恶魔
- Devil! - No devil.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.395
- 是我 美第奇    - 把他绑结实了
- Just a Medici. - Bind him securely!

00:44:57.167 --> 00:44:59.968
这个诅咒从修女那里
For this curse to pass from the nuns

00:45:00.036 --> 00:45:02.771
传到一个夜巡官身上
to one of the Officers of the Night,

00:45:02.838 --> 00:45:05.773
答案肯定就在眼前
the answer has to be right before us.

00:45:05.841 --> 00:45:07.942
- 你的人今天吃了什么   - 什么都没吃
- What has your man eaten today? - Nothing.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:11.645
他斋戒祝祷 以帮助这些饱受磨难的修女们
He offered up a fast to Our Lord to help the afflicted nuns.

00:45:11.713 --> 00:45:14.248
- 他是一个虔诚的人  - 是我们中最虔诚的
- A pious man. - The most pious of us all.

00:45:14.316 --> 00:45:15.602
每时每刻 他都在向圣安东尼祈祷
Every moment, he would pray to Saint Anthony

00:45:15.603 --> 00:45:16.326
愿这些女人摆脱苦痛
to end the women's agony.

00:45:21.257 --> 00:45:24.025
- 他是怎样祈祷的   - 亲吻圣像的脚面
- How did he pray? - Kissing the feet of the statue.

00:45:24.093 --> 00:45:26.561
这习俗已形成世纪之久
It's been a custom for centuries.

00:45:26.629 --> 00:45:28.997
凡妮莎和其他的人 她们也这样祈祷过吗
Vanessa, the others - did they practice the same custom?

00:45:29.065 --> 00:45:32.200
这里很多修女都这么做
Many of the Sisters here do.

00:45:32.268 --> 00:45:36.738
是时候让你们的守护神为我们指点迷津了
It may be time for your patron to shed some light on our problem.

00:45:36.805 --> 00:45:38.406
给我逮些萤火虫来
I need fireflies.

00:45:56.158 --> 00:45:58.492
吃子
A capture.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.127
你把我教得很好
You've taught me well.

00:46:00.195 --> 00:46:04.265
我的胜利近在咫尺
My first victory is close at hand.

00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:09.904
"你要当心 不要把孤注一掷的对手逼得太紧
"You should be careful not to press a desperate foe too hard.

00:46:09.972 --> 00:46:16.211
"否则你将会圣心大发 受控于他
"Or you may find yourself at the mercy of a divine move.

00:46:16.279 --> 00:46:23.886
"对手顿生灵悟 转败为胜"
"The inspired play turns a losing game into victory.’

00:46:23.954 --> 00:46:27.223
让你的人把灯都熄灭
Have your men douse their lanterns.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:28.924
那些傻瓜们又在干嘛
What are the fools up to now?

00:46:28.992 --> 00:46:31.360
这无关紧要  一切即将揭晓
It matters not, this ends now.

00:46:31.427 --> 00:46:33.929
通常而言 不同的光线特质不同
On occaision,the distinct properties of different lights

00:46:33.996 --> 00:46:37.966
可以让我们看清很多本看不到的东西
enable us to see clearly what may previously have been hidden.

00:46:38.034 --> 00:46:39.380
比如 一群发光的萤火虫
The glow of the firefly,for instance,

00:46:39.381 --> 00:46:41.536
能强化红色
intensifies anything red.

00:46:41.604 --> 00:46:43.738
过去 我曾用它将我画作中的深红校至精准
I've used it in the past to calibrate crimson in my paints to the most specific degree.

00:46:45.808 --> 00:46:47.842
但这和那些恶魔又有什么关联
But what does this have to do with the demons?

00:46:50.012 --> 00:46:53.782
事实证明 密切相关
Everything, as it turns out.

00:46:53.849 --> 00:46:57.119
比如 一些菌类 会在特定灯光下呈现亮红色
Some fungi, for instance, appear bright red in certain lights.

00:47:05.528 --> 00:47:07.763
我烧起来了  快驱逐他
Burning! Make it stop!

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.465
我会的  孩子
I will, my child.

00:47:09.533 --> 00:47:13.102
为她们撒油  驱魔时间到
Prepare them with oil. Time to burn the devil out!

00:47:24.448 --> 00:47:25.882
标记她
Brand her.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.852
禾草的真菌性疾病 麦角病症状: 致幻 痉挛 妇女的流产 乾性坏疽 甚至死亡

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.454
它通常长在黑麦上
It normally grows on rye.

00:47:30.522 --> 00:47:34.258
染病后果可畏：痉挛 呕吐 水肿 坏疽
The effects are dire: spasms, vomiting, dropsy, gangrene,

00:47:34.326 --> 00:47:36.260
还有 听幸存者说
and, according to survivors,

00:47:36.328 --> 00:47:40.797
会有强烈的灼痛感 就如经受炼狱之火一样
a distinct sensation of being burned, as if by hellfire.

00:47:40.865 --> 00:47:42.365
它能扰乱人的心智
It scrambles the mind, you see.

00:47:42.433 --> 00:47:44.534
致人产生幻觉和癫狂
It causes hallucinations and mania.

00:47:44.602 --> 00:47:46.377
你和他们一样心智错乱 达·芬奇
Your mind is as scrambled as theirs, Da Vinci.

00:47:46.378 --> 00:47:48.005
让开 否则就把你也烧死
Now move aside or burn.

00:47:48.072 --> 00:47:51.474
我们必须要净化这个修道院 烧灭传染源
We must cleanse this convent, cauterize the infection.

00:47:51.542 --> 00:47:53.443
这些修女们已经没救了
The nuns are beyond help,

00:47:53.511 --> 00:47:55.578
她们是邪灵侵害的牺牲品
victims of a spiritual assault.

00:47:55.646 --> 00:47:57.680
如果是这样 我同意你的做法
On that account, I agree with you.

00:47:57.748 --> 00:47:59.382
是受一群妄图利用圣灵做武器的人侵害所致
An assault perpetrated by agents who would seek to weaponize the Holy Spirit.

00:48:05.455 --> 00:48:09.457
外面的圣像脚上铺满了麦角菌
The feet of the statue outside are dusted with ergot.

00:48:09.525 --> 00:48:10.247
在得病前 所有受害者们
All of the victims kissed

00:48:10.248 --> 00:48:10.969
都亲吻过圣安东尼的脚面
the feet of Saint Anthony before falling sick.

00:48:13.696 --> 00:48:15.498
所有饱受折磨的修女们
All of the stricken Sisters,

00:48:15.499 --> 00:48:18.266
凡妮莎 还有你那虔诚的军官 贝尔蒂诺
Vanessa - even your pious Officer, Bertino.

00:48:18.334 --> 00:48:20.069
每一个人
To a person.

00:48:20.136 --> 00:48:22.404
- 你的说法太荒唐了  - 是吗
- What you're suggesting is absurd! - Is it?

00:48:22.472 --> 00:48:24.425
那为什么你和格伦瓦尔德队长的人
Then why have neither you

00:48:24.426 --> 00:48:25.207
都没被感染呢
nor Captain Grunwald's men fallen sick?

00:48:25.274 --> 00:48:27.276
嗯
Hmm?

00:48:27.343 --> 00:48:29.512
为何像美第奇大人这样的异教徒
Why aren't heretics like Signor Medici,

00:48:29.579 --> 00:48:32.348
或是小尼克和我却没有得病呢
or young Nico, or myself fallen sick?

00:48:32.415 --> 00:48:34.984
是因为我们没有对雕像致意
It's because we made no obeisance to the statue.

00:48:35.052 --> 00:48:36.619
你和你的人也没有
Nor did you or your men.

00:48:36.687 --> 00:48:39.388
我一刻也无法容忍这种恶意的诽谤
I won't stand for this fatuous slander another moment.

00:48:39.456 --> 00:48:40.747
好吧 你只有一种办法去证明我是错的
Well, all you need to do is

00:48:40.748 --> 00:48:43.091
去亲吻圣安东尼的脚
kiss the feet of Saint Anthony to prove me wrong.

00:48:47.964 --> 00:48:50.932
麦角病
"Red ergot"?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.168
谁会听过这种东西
Who ever heard of such a thing?

00:48:53.236 --> 00:48:56.172
停下 我来告诉你
Stop! I will tell you.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.575
一位为杰弗瑞·德·布洛伊的历史学家
A historian by the name of Geoffroy du Breuil

00:48:59.643 --> 00:49:02.612
记录了12世纪的一次大肆虐
recorded one such outbreak in the 12th century.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.030
或许你就有它的副本
Perhaps you have a copy of it,

00:49:05.031 --> 00:49:07.851
藏在你的秘密卷宗里
hidden amongst your Secret Archives?

00:49:11.256 --> 00:49:13.690
此病有治愈方法
A treatment for this affliction exists.

00:49:13.758 --> 00:49:16.994
敷用这些草药和醋制成的绿色药膏
It's a green ointment of these herbs and vinegar,

00:49:17.061 --> 00:49:19.429
以及使用鲜活的水蛭给病人吸血
and a vigorous regime of leeching.

00:49:22.566 --> 00:49:24.379
我们用了此方 说不定还来得及
If we use this, we may still

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:27.036
挽救那些病人性命
be able to save those who've fallen sick.

00:49:27.103 --> 00:49:29.238
干得好 达·芬奇
Well done, Da Vinci.

00:49:31.775 --> 00:49:33.142
谢谢你 大师
Thank you Maestro.

00:50:25.831 --> 00:50:27.364
你自己知道为何带我们来这
You know why you brought us here.

00:50:28.667 --> 00:50:31.202
我们用死来证明你的天赋
We died to prove your genius.

00:50:45.753 --> 00:50:48.454
里亚里奥
Riario!

00:51:09.376 --> 00:51:12.312
告诉我要说什么才能拿到另一把钥匙
Tell me what to say to win the other key.

00:51:12.379 --> 00:51:15.815
告诉我要说什么才能拿到那把钥匙
Tell me what to say to win the key!

00:51:15.883 --> 00:51:17.183
告诉我!
Tell me!

00:51:20.321 --> 00:51:24.524
我是大地与星空之子
I am a son of Earth and starry Heaven.

00:51:25.826 --> 00:51:30.729
我是大地与星空之子
I am a son of Earth and starry...

00:51:36.871 --> 00:51:38.371
妈妈
Mother?

00:51:46.848 --> 00:51:48.248
妈妈
Mother?

00:51:48.316 --> 00:51:51.585
达·芬奇 你听得到我说话么
Da Vinci... can you hear me?

00:51:51.653 --> 00:51:53.621
我觉得他有反应了
I think he's starting to respond.

00:52:01.597 --> 00:52:05.000
大师 你还好么?
Maestro...are you alright?

00:52:05.068 --> 00:52:08.470
你一直眼神呆滞 大喊大叫
You kept stirring and crying out.

00:52:08.538 --> 00:52:11.307
凡妮莎的唇
Vanessa's lips.

00:52:11.375 --> 00:52:14.977
凡妮莎的唇上 有麦角菌
Vanessa's lips... they bore the poison.

00:52:18.348 --> 00:52:20.749
- 我深陷幻觉   - 我们知道
- I was in a deep vision.   - Yes, we know.

00:52:20.817 --> 00:52:24.253
修女们已经为你治疗一整天了
The Sisters have been treating you all day long.

00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:27.623
凡妮莎 她痊愈了么
Vanessa? Is she - - Perfectly fine.

00:52:32.229 --> 00:52:35.765
你阻止了罗马虏获去一位美丽的受害者
You've kept Rome from claiming a beautiful victim.

00:52:35.833 --> 00:52:37.901
现在一切都结束了
It's all over now.

00:52:37.968 --> 00:52:40.503
对我来说 恐怕这才是个开始
For me, I fear it's just begun.

00:52:44.842 --> 00:52:46.576
"滚开 撒旦
"Begone Satan,

00:52:46.644 --> 00:52:48.245
经上记载
for it is written,

00:52:48.313 --> 00:52:50.787
你们应朝拜上主 敬奉上帝
you shall worship the Lord your God,

00:52:50.788 --> 00:52:52.850
仅听从上帝的指示"
and Him only shall you serve."

00:52:52.917 --> 00:52:54.685
你也熟知经文
You know your scripture.

00:52:54.753 --> 00:52:58.723
我现在知道很多事 主教大人
I now know a great many things, Cardinal.

00:53:01.727 --> 00:53:05.096
你应把这一口信传给里亚里奥
That's a message worth delivering to Riario.

00:53:05.164 --> 00:53:10.602
相信我 里亚里奥伯爵和我还有很多要探讨
Believe me, Count Riario and I have much to discuss.

00:53:17.142 --> 00:53:20.111
他们怎么做到的 大师?
How did they do it, Maestro?

00:53:20.179 --> 00:53:22.246
这不难
It wouldn't have been hard.

00:53:22.314 --> 00:53:27.118
正如院长所说 修道院为所有礼拜者开放
The Convent's open to all worshipers, as the Prioress said.

00:53:27.186 --> 00:53:30.488
随便一个颇富同情心的人 都可以信步走入
Just one single, sympathetic agent could have strolled in,

00:53:30.556 --> 00:53:34.726
在圣安东尼的脚趾上撒毒
contaminated the toes of Saint Anthony...

00:53:34.794 --> 00:53:38.863
然后静静等待
..And waited.

00:53:38.931 --> 00:53:43.634
深渊与深渊响应
And then Abyssus abyssum invocat

00:53:43.702 --> 00:53:45.736
一着不慎 满盘皆输
One misstep leads to another.

00:54:09.095 --> 00:54:12.531
他们对虔诚的信徒下了毒
They poisoned the pious.

00:54:12.598 --> 00:54:15.700
主啊 可怜可怜这些信徒吧
Oh, God, have mercy on the believers.

00:54:15.768 --> 00:54:18.603
我们为佛罗伦萨争取了更多的时间
We just bought Florence more time.

00:54:24.677 --> 00:54:27.478
- 怎么了   - 一个骑手带来话
- What is it? - A rider brought word.

00:54:27.546 --> 00:54:30.848
你弟弟一不小心把咱们的军火数量说漏了
Your brother let slip how many guns we have.

00:54:30.916 --> 00:54:33.150
虽说武器还在生产 但
Production continues, but...

00:54:33.218 --> 00:54:35.219
朱利亚诺本可设法蒙蔽他们 可他却承认了
Giuliano could've hidden his error but admitted it.

00:54:35.287 --> 00:54:37.455
瞧他干的好事
For all the good that does.

00:54:37.523 --> 00:54:41.759
摸清底细之后 罗马会立刻发起进攻的
Rome will strike when it knows exactly what it faces.

00:54:41.827 --> 00:54:44.028
我们现在要生产更多炮火
We'll have to produce even more guns now.

00:54:46.298 --> 00:54:47.670
对 我叫人搜遍了整个宫殿
Oh, yes, I ordered a full

00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:49.867
不放过任何角落
search of the palace, no stone unturned.

00:54:49.934 --> 00:54:51.201
你有什么发现么?
Have you discovered something?

00:54:51.269 --> 00:54:53.903
可能我们应该私下讨论
Perhaps we should discuss this in private.

00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:58.939
现在就给我看 孔蒂
Show me now, Conti, or

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:08.651
否则我就认为是你在掩饰什么
I'll think it's you with something to hide.

00:55:08.719 --> 00:55:10.220
你在哪找到的这个
Where did you find this?

00:55:10.287 --> 00:55:12.489
哪里
Where?

00:55:12.556 --> 00:55:14.124
在贝奇大人的住处
In Signor Becchi's quarters.

00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:16.092
你撒谎
You lie!

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.861
这些不是我的
These are not mine!

00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:20.397
我是在架子上找到的 大人 我发誓
It was on a shelf, il Magnifico. I swear.

00:55:20.464 --> 00:55:22.132
藏于其他书籍之间
Hidden amongst other books.

00:55:22.199 --> 00:55:26.537
是你
It was you.

00:55:26.604 --> 00:55:28.271
自始至终 叛徒都是你
All along, the traitor was you.

00:55:28.339 --> 00:55:30.340
洛伦佐 这是个误会
Lorenzo, this is a mistake.

00:55:30.408 --> 00:55:32.742
罗马斯库多
Roman Scudos.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.177
印有罗马教宗封印的纸张
Papers with the Papal Seal.

00:55:34.245 --> 00:55:38.782
送往罗马的情报掩藏地
A list of locations to hide them for delivery to Rome.

00:55:38.849 --> 00:55:42.286
家贼难防啊
Found in my home!

00:55:42.353 --> 00:55:44.021
- 不要怀疑我 洛伦佐   - 闭嘴
- Please, Lorenzo... - Silence!

00:55:44.088 --> 00:55:46.256
否则我会亲自割下你的舌头
Or I'll cut out your tongue myself.

00:55:50.428 --> 00:55:51.628
把他带走
Remove him.

00:55:56.501 --> 00:55:58.235
交给巴杰罗处置
To the Bargello.

00:56:01.606 --> 00:56:03.474
看来你好像又赢了
It would appear you've won again.

00:56:05.344 --> 00:56:08.345
一盘结束 一盘又始
There will be other games.

00:56:08.413 --> 00:56:11.949
选择要走的路
It's difficult, choosing which path to follow,

00:56:12.017 --> 00:56:17.255
试图透过精心设计的策略看到光明大道 这很难
trying to see a way through all the strategies you've initiated.

00:56:17.322 --> 00:56:19.023
不
No.

00:56:19.091 --> 00:56:22.360
不 那不难
No, that's not difficult.

00:56:22.428 --> 00:56:25.663
只要有信仰便可
You simply have to believe.

00:56:25.731 --> 00:56:28.700
以我之见 信仰绝不简单
In my experience, there's nothing simple about belief.

00:56:28.767 --> 00:56:31.503
这就是你我的不同之处
That's the difference between you and me.

00:56:34.507 --> 00:56:35.774
不同之处 不仅一个
Not the only one.

00:56:50.024 --> 00:56:52.892
我听到你叫我了
I heard you.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.627
